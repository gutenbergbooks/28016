<h2><i>PREFACE</i></h2>


<p><i><span class="smcap">This</span> book contains no thrilling adventures, chronicles,
no days devoted to sport. It will probably interest
only those minds which are content with "the C Major of
this life," and which find in other than scenes of peril and
excitement their hearts' desire.</i></p>

<p><i>Such as care to wander through its pages must have
learnt to enjoy idleness, nor find weeks spent beneath the
sun and stars too long&mdash;that is to say, the fascination of
a wandering, irresponsible life should be known to them:
waste and solitary places must not appal, nor trifling
incident weary, while human natures remotely removed
from their own, alternately delight and repel. Those who
understand not these things, will find but a dull chronicle
within the following pages.</i></p>

<p><i>If to live is to know more, and to know more only to love
more, the least eventful day may possess a minimum of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a>[<a href="./images/vi.png">vi</a>]</span>
value, and even quiet monotones and grey vistas be found
and lost in a glamour born of themselves.</i></p>

<p><i>In this loud and insistent world the silent places are
often overlooked, and yet they are never empty.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The vague and hazy ideals which the white light of an
English upbringing relegates to dreamland and dismisses as idle

and veiled women, the despotism and stoicism, the unchanging
picturesqueness of the Thousand and One Nights, the dramatic
inevitability of the Old Testament.&mdash;A. J. D.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no desert in Morocco.</p>

<p>If a country has not been "read up" beforehand,
the imagination has free play and forms many false conclusions:
yet though it suffer on the one hand rude
awakenings, it is on the other compensated by certain
new lights&mdash;indelible and unique impressions&mdash;which come
only in the train of things <i>inconnu</i>. So though we found
no desert, there are other things in Morocco.</p>

<p>It is one of the few countries in the world, and they
grow fewer each year, which is still unexplored&mdash;unknown.
Thousands of square miles in Morocco have never been
crossed by a European, or at any rate none have returned
to tell the tale: maps mark only blank spaces, and have
no names for villages, no records of mountains or rivers:
there are no roads, still less railways, in the country:
the only means of transport along the wild, worn tracks
is by camels, mules, and donkeys: he who will not ride
perforce walks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
The bare fringe alone of Morocco, its coast towns, and
the choice, let us say, of two roads connecting them with
its capitals, Fez and Morocco City, are open to travellers;
beyond these limits it is difficult and dangerous for
Europeans to venture. Of even its coasts towns England
knows little enough: a daily paper printed in 1902 describes
one flourishing seaport of thirty thousand inhabitants as
"a village." There is more vagueness, in fact, about a
country three times the size of Great Britain and four
days' journey from London than of many a remote corner
in the heart of Asia.</p>

<p>The reason is at hand. An old Arabic proverb, "The
earth is a peacock: Morocco is the tail of it," typifies
the entire satisfaction of its inhabitants with their native
land. What is, is good; why "civilize" and "progress"?
As far as possible there shall no European enter therein.
Realizing that, were new blood allowed to come into
Morocco, its own effete and uneducated people would have
no chance in the race of life, and end by hopelessly knuckling
under to the European, the country isolates itself;
nor is it likely that the jealous Powers of Europe will
allow any one of their number to disturb that isolation
and pluck the tempting fruit.</p>

<p>And so to-day Morocco drowses in an atmosphere of
<i>laissez faire</i>, a decadent nation, a collection of lawless
tribes, who have changed little for the last two thousand
years, living still much after the manner of Old Testament
days. They are devout Mussulmans. They believe the
world to be flat, and to come to an end with the west
coast of Morocco. Their country they call <i>El Moghreb
el Aksa</i>, which means, "The Extreme West," or "The
Land of the Setting Sun": "Morocco" and "Moors"
are entirely European words, and never used by the
Moors themselves&mdash;the one being a corruption of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
name of their capital city, the other having been given
them by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Morocco should be fascinating on the face of it: a
great country running into hundreds of thousands of
square miles, the only independent Mussulman state of
North Africa, with six million followers of the great
Prophet, and a perfect climate, soil, and water-supply to
boot, needs no extolling. And yet its chiefest fascination
lies in things which, from some points of view, ought
not to be.</p>

<p>Its remote removal from all appertaining to the twentieth
century, its strangely simple, untaught life, the solemn,
stately men, the veiled women and their eyes, the steely
blue cactus, the white cities and the glaring light, the
mystery and the fatalism which intensify the air, are alike
oddly inevitable and incomprehensible to a European.
The other side of the closed door has always constituted,
for the wandering vagrants among mankind, their hearts'
desire. For them there is still Morocco; and the door
will be shut in their faces again and again by a people
and a faith and customs which they can never understand.
And though it be useless they will still go on, because
it seems the best thing.</p>

<p>About six weeks before 1902 was due, Rose A. Bainbridge
and myself left behind us the last outpost of England&mdash;Gibraltar&mdash;with
its cluster of civilization round the bottom
of the great Rock. Four hours brought us across the
Straits; and seen from the deck of the dirty little <i>Gibel
Musa</i>, on to which we had changed from a P. &amp; O.
at Gibraltar, Morocco shaped itself into a rugged country,
ridge behind ridge of low hills and jagged mountains
cutting the sky-line. A long white sand-bank lying back
in a bay on the African shore, broken at one end by
irregular vegetation, gradually developed upon its slopes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>
a yellowish-white, fantastic city, which resolved itself
into Tangier.</p>

<p>Landing at Tangier among vociferating Moors has
been described often enough, and needs no further enlargement.</p>

<p>The next morning, November 13, 1901, found us sitting
over coffee and an omelette out of doors, on a little
balcony opening off the hotel Villa Valentina, over-looking
the road to Fez, and facing the broad, blue
Straits which divided us from Europe.</p>

<p>It was like a June morning at home, soft and balmy:
the city dropped from us down to the beach, and the
sun poured upon the flat-roofed houses, coloured yellow
to pale cream or washed-out blue, alternating with a
lavish coat of glaring whitewash.</p>

<p>Tangier is an example of structure without architecture;
at the same time there is a certain fitness in the
crude Moorish buildings, whose flat expanse of wall
is unbroken either by windows or ornament: they are
simple and "reserved." Gleaming in high light under
an equally light sky, they huddle almost one on top
of the other, built upon every available square yard
inside the "papery" old city wall, which looks as if
cannon would blow it away. Patches of blue sea break
the white city outline, and the towers of the mosques
rise above it all: their tesselated surfaces, tiled in shades
of green and polished by the years, shimmer in the
sunshine like peacocks' tails.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-02.png"><img src="./images/ill-02_th.png" alt="THE ROAD TO FEZ." title="THE ROAD TO FEZ." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">The Road to Fez.</p>

<p>Two or three gateways pierce the drab-coloured city wall,
their horseshoe-shaped arches washed over with salmon-pink.
The same plaster-work arch repeats itself occasionally
in the rough stone- and mortar-work of the houses,
all of an inferior quality, short-lived and rebuilt again
and again on the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of successive years, until they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
stand in time right above the cobble-stones of the narrow
streets.</p>

<p>Outside the city wall a few private houses and two
hotels lie back among eucalyptus, palms, and bushy
stone-pines: several of the legations which represent the
European Powers have modern houses, lost in greenery
of sorts. Behind these, again, a suburb of jerry-built
Spanish houses, with the scum of Spain, is inclined to grow,
which offshoot of fifth-rate Europe gives at last upon the
rolling pastures and windswept hills of the open country.</p>

<p>Our breakfast-table brought us face to face with every
traveller who passed along the great sandy track leading
eventually to Fez, which people in Morocco call a road,
beaten to-day and for the last two thousand years by the
feet of generations of camels, mules, donkeys, horses, cattle,
and mankind.</p>

<p>Though the wayfarers, plodding through the dusty
hoof-marks, were desultory, it was quiet for few hours even
at night, and under our windows we waked to an eternal
shuffling in the soft sand, the champing of bits, and
guttural Arabic tones.</p>

<p>R. and I leaned over the balcony. Women passed us
wrapped in voluminous whity-yellow garments&mdash;<i>haiks</i>&mdash;black
eyes and red slippers alone showing. Date-coloured
boys passed us, wearing red fezes and dirty-white turbans.
Countrymen passed us in great, coarse, brown woollen
cloaks&mdash;<i>jellabs</i>&mdash;the hood pulled right on over the head,
short wide sleeves, the front joined all down, and having
scarred bare legs and feet coming out from underneath.
These drove strings of diminutive donkeys, a couple of
water-barrels balanced across the back of each&mdash;supplies
of water for Tangier when the rain-water tanks are giving
out: there are few wells in the city.</p>

<p>More women, veiled to the eyes, passed us, in delightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
shoes&mdash;milk-coloured leather, embroidered with green:
an African woman, black as a boot, with thick negro
lips and yellow metal bracelets on her charcoal-sticks of
arms. More donkeys passed us, carrying vegetables to
market, driven by countrywomen in yellowish-white haiks,
vast straw hats, and the inevitable veil. Two men passed
us with an immense open box containing thousands of eggs,
hung between them by a pole on the shoulder of each&mdash;export
for England: forty-eight millions were sent off in
1902, and this morning's omelette might not be our first
Morocco egg. A Moor of some means came by, riding
at a hard-held ambling walk his star-gazing white mule:
the high-peaked saddle and bridle were of scarlet cloth,
the stirrup-leathers of scarlet twisted wool; he wore a
creamy woollen haik, falling in soft folds down to his
yellow slippers, a turban whose snowy disc of enormous
size framed his cinnamon-coloured face in symmetrical
folds of spotless white, and the top of a scarlet fez showed
in the centre of it.</p>

<p>Almost opposite us a beggar had sat himself down at
the edge of the road, under the shelter of the high cane
fence&mdash;a grimy old greybeard, tanned and worn like a
walnut, in a tattered jellab and shady turban. "For the
love of God; for the love of God," he rolled out incessantly
in Arabic, ending in a throaty gobble like a
turkey; and the country people threw him, as they passed,
of their bundles&mdash;here an orange, there a lump of charcoal&mdash;whatever
it might be it was crammed into the hood of
the jellab; and the sing-song and the gobble began again.
In a Mohammedan country it is counted a duty as well
as a holy deed to encourage beggars: almsgiving represents
to the faithful Mussulman equivalent gain in
Paradise; and no one starves in Morocco, though occasionally
dismissed with a wave of the hand and "God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>
provide for you." Mad people are regarded as saints, and
credited with the gift of prophecy. It is an exceedingly
holy thing to walk about naked. A holy man in Fez
was in the habit of sitting at a missionary's gate stark
naked; eventually this proceeding had to be put a stop
to, because the holy man would insist upon holding the
horses of the missionary's afternoon callers.</p>

<p>Our beggar sat in the same spot day after day, hour
after hour, fatuitously happy, blissfully content. "God is
great, and what is written is written": remorse, regrets, are
alike unknown to Mussulmen; and it is this which dignifies
their religion and themselves. Life passes lightly over
them, and chisels few lines and puckers in the serene
patriarchal faces&mdash;they may be scamps of the first water,
for all one can tell; it sits lightly upon them.</p>

<p>A small boy in a white tunic and red fez, who called
himself Larbi, was playing about near the beggar:
being able to speak a little English, he made himself
useful to visitors, and was rapidly exchanging his good
qualities for the drawbacks of the hanger-on: he came
out with us for a day or two, smoked several cigarettes
in the course of the afternoon, and picked us useless
bunches of ordinary flowers. Remonstrance was futile,
but when no more little silver coins were forthcoming
he left off shadowing us.</p>

<p>We found our own way down to the great <i>sok</i>, or
market-place, in the wake of some donkeys carrying
live cackling fowls, fastened by a bit of string and their
feet to any part of the donkey and its baskets which
came handy. On each side of the road and everywhere
in Tangier the obstinate steely-grey cactus, or prickly
pear, dominates the landscape: its fat fleshy leaves make
as good a protection as the sharp-pointed aloe round
the irregular plots of cultivated ground. Alternating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
with them, tall bound cane fences swish and rattle in
the wind.</p>

<p>Steely-grey and a yellow-bleached white describe the
vegetation of Tangier, set in its white sand-dunes. Morocco
is far from having lot or part in the gorgeous East, as
tradition says. To begin with, from the end of August
to the end of April hazy days greatly predominate, and
thirty inches of rain are put in: naturally the country
and people take their cue from the general colour of
the sky, from its white-yellow light, in which a wan sun
is yet able to produce a glare. Morocco is yellow-white,
and the Moors themselves run from the colour of cinnamon,
through shades of coffee and old gold, to biscuit and
skim-milk. Their houses and their clothes take on the
same whites and greys, yellows and browns, and the sand
and the scrub again and again repeat the tale. Perhaps
it has a saddening effect, borne out in the colourless
monotone of the lives of its countrywomen.</p>

<p>Presently we passed a skin-yard, salted goat-skins, drying
by the hundred under the sun, spread upon the ground,
upon the flat roofs, wherever a skin could lie, curling
with dryness, the empty legs of the late owners standing
stiff and upright, like petrified stockings, pointing
dismally to heaven.</p>

<p>We overtook a string of camels as we neared the sok,
strolling along and regarding the skies, R. and myself
with an exaggerated superciliousness. They were laden
with dates, carpets, and slippers from Fez, and, together
with mules and donkeys, constitute the vans and railway-trucks
of Morocco, substituting over the face of the land
a dilatory calm in the place of speed and bustle.</p>

<p>But at first it was a real effort to take in a tenth part
of surroundings so different from those of England; and
when we found ourselves in the sok&mdash;the <i>hub</i> of Moorish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
life&mdash;it was to be jostled by donkey-drivers shouting
"Baarak! Baarak!" by black water-carriers from the Sus
country, by veiled women, by negroes from Timbuctoo,
by mules and camels, by men walking, men riding,
without one sight or sound familiar, in a dream-world
of intense life, recalling nothing so much as the Old
Testament. It was worth the journey out from home
to see this sok&mdash;an open space crawling with brown-and-white,
cloaked and hooded humanity, mixed up with
four-legged beasts, also brown, and the whole more like
a magnified ant-hill on the flat than anything human.
In front of the squatted country people their stock-in-trade
lay in piles, gorgeous in tone: oranges and oranges
and more oranges, selling at one thousand seven hundred
for a shilling; scarlet chillies&mdash;hot blots of colour; pink
onions; red carrots; white salt, collected down on the
beach; green pumpkins blotched with yellow; besides
grain of all sorts, basketsful of charcoal, bundles of
wood, dried fruit, flat round loaves of bread, cabbages,
and what not. The sound of a perpetual muffin-bell was
ringing backwards and forwards&mdash;the <i>bhisti</i> of Tangier,
with his hairy goatskinful of water across his back, and
two bright brass bowls hung by a chain round his neck,
a bell in one hand, with the other dealing out drinks
of water for a Moorish copper coin of which a penny
contains fifteen.</p>

<p>We elbowed our way through the <i>B&aacute;b-el-Sok</i>, or Gate
of the Market-place, into the city, and found ourselves
in a long, narrow, straight street, dropping down to the
<i>marsa</i>, or harbour. The irregular, light colour-washed
houses jut out promiscuously over the minute cupboard-like
shops crammed with oddments of every sort and
hue, and leaving scanty room for the owner to squat
on some carpet or mattress, until it strikes him that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
is time to eat or go to prayers, and he locks up the
double doors of his "store cupboard" and strolls away.</p>

<p>Looking down this attenuated Piccadilly of Tangier,
over the white turbans and red fezes of the multitude,
right away at the far end a field of blue sea was to be
seen: half-way between, the faithful were beginning to
pass into the big mosque one by one for midday prayers,
each leaving his shoes behind him and stepping over the
high doorstep barefoot on to the marble floor beyond,
thence disappearing behind the ponderous green iron
doors, where the great line is drawn between Europeans
and Asiatics, debarring from entry any except Mussulmen.</p>

<p>The Villa Valentina breakfasted at 12.45, and cut the
morning short. We were out again later with a guide&mdash;Hadj
Riffi he called himself&mdash;bent on a visit to the <i>Kasbah</i>,
or fortress of the city.</p>

<p>Hadj Riffi provided a donkey and pack, which of all
substitutes for saddles is most foolish, intended only for
loads of all sorts to be slung across them; but packs
are easy to slip off and on, and have answered their
purpose in Morocco since the days when in Jud&aelig;a Mary
rode on one to Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Conducted through the queer, intricate city, we wound
along maze-like alleys three or four feet wide, ever
the old aromatic smell of the East, almost impossible to
recall, yet recognized again in an instant's flash, and
born of the Oriental world we jostled against&mdash;of Berbers,
Arabs, negroes, men from the Sahara, men from the
mountains of the Riff, Turks, Greeks, Levantines, Syrians,
even an occasional Hindoo, all wanderers up and down
the earth, unable to resist the call of the open road,
engendered by nomadic habits of old.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-03.png"><img src="./images/ill-03_th.png" alt="R. ON A PACK." title="R. ON A PACK." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">R. on a Pack.</p>

<p>One word on the inhabitants of the country. The
Berbers are the aborigines of Morocco, and live more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
or less in the hills and mountains, into which they were
driven by the Arabs in the seventh century, when they
overran Morocco. The Arabs, on the other hand, live
in the plains; and Arabs and Berbers practically halve
the country between them. Both peoples divide into
numerous tribes, of which the men from the Riff are
a Berber tribe. The negroes in Morocco are merely
slaves imported from the south. One and all the Arab
and Berber tribes are called indiscriminately by
Europeans "Moors." The other wanderers in Tangier
filter through the land from their own countries: who
can tell why or wherefore? Hadj Riffi himself had
obeyed his Prophet Mohammed in so far as to make
the pilgrimage to Mecca. A journey the prospect of
which would horrify a tradesman at home is undertaken
by an earnest-minded shop-keeping Moor as a matter
of course. What are the twelve uncomfortable days by
sea to Jeddah? Or the journey thence to Mecca, lying
stretched in a long pannier on one side of a camel,
balanced by a second pilgrim in a pannier on the other
side, and over the whole an awning spread? But this
luxurious travelling is for the rich pilgrim, who swings
silently along day after day, under the burning sun or
the cold stars, across the tideless sea of sand, towards
an illimitable horizon. Hadj Riffi "footed it," spent
three days at Mecca, at this time transformed into a
city of a myriad tents, among which it is easy enough to
be lost, teeming with pilgrims&mdash;Chinese, Hindoos, Circassians,
Georgians, Bosnians&mdash;most of them unable to understand
each other, beyond a verse or two from the Kor&#257;n
and a few pious ejaculations.</p>

<p>Hadj Riffi and his fellow-Moors prayed three days
at Mecca, and performed the ceremonies round the
celebrated <i>K&#257;aba</i>, the chief shrine and holiest of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
holy places, built by Adam and Eve after the pattern
of their own Sanctum Sanctorum in the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>The far-famed Black Stone, presented to the masons
by the Angel Gabriel, built into the east corner of the
outer wall of the K&#257;aba, is a semicircular fragment
of volcanic basalt, sprinkled with coloured crystals,
about six by eight inches large, bordered with silver,
and the surface of it reddish brown, undulating, and
polished.</p>

<p>Having kissed the Black Stone and performed other
rites, the Moors went three days' journey to the Prophet's
Mountain to pray; then they took themselves back to
Morocco, but on their way, missing a steamer, were
obliged to travel by land through Tunis, which took
them five months, and, running short of money, lived,
Hadj Riffi said, largely on roots.</p>

<p>In the meantime he urged our donkey along, breaking
his discourse with "Arrah! Arrah!" until at last it was
cajoled under the gateway and into the Kasbah. This
fortress, reported a good specimen of Moorish architecture,
could impress nobody: it has no regular garrison; the
batteries are antiquated, the artillery hopelessly inefficient.
The crumbling battlements are overgrown with rank
grass and fig-trees, though tradition has it they were
once brass, when the city was built of gold and silver.</p>

<p>Tangier is immensely old, and has seen many conquerors,
many demolitions. Arabs, Greeks, Carthaginians,
Romans, Goths, Spaniards, and Portuguese have all in
their turn besieged and taken, ruled and deserted, the
white city. England has had her turn too. When
Charles II. married Catherine of Braganza, Tangier and
Bombay formed part of her dowry and passed into British
hands. The Portuguese, to whom Tangier then belonged,
withdrew; the English entered, repaired the city wall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
built forts, and in the course of three years a great mole
across the harbour at a cost of &pound;31,000. Trade increased
rapidly under the protection of the plucky Tangier
Regiment (now the Queen's Royal West Surrey). An
English mayor and corporation&mdash;six aldermen and
twelve Common Council men&mdash;were established in the
little colony, and attended church in scarlet and purple.</p>

<p>And then the Home Government made a mistake.
The slovenly Tangier board in London wasted money,
sent adventurers out to Tangier as governors. An exposure
of their mismanagement followed, which induced
the Home Government to throw up a troublesome charge,
and to evacuate as valuable a port as England ever
possessed, in a country which, unlike India, is admirably
adapted for European colonization, and blessed with every
natural advantage Creation can offer.</p>

<p>The mole and fortifications were blown up, Lord
Dartmouth and his garrison marched out of Tangier
on February 6, 1684, and the Moors took possession of
a heap of fragmentary ruins. With Tangier in our hands
we could have confidently commanded the passage of
the Straits for seventy miles, nor would there have been
a risk to Gibraltar of having all her supplies cut off
in the event of Spain and Morocco being hostile to us.
Fresh-comers to Morocco regret these things: in a few
weeks the spirit of the country induces a lazy tolerance
and a general apathy towards the past as well as towards
the present state of affairs.</p>

<p>We found inside the Kasbah an entirely Moorish element&mdash;one
sacred spot where no "Christians" may live. A
children's school was making a deafening noise on our
right, and we looked in to see a group of small boys
sitting round an ancient, turbaned Moor, who was sewing
at a jellab and paying small attention to his pupils: one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
and all were on their heels, lighted by the open door,
there being of course no windows; and each held in his
two hands a board inscribed with Arabic characters, which
he swayed backwards and forwards as he swayed his
body in time with sentences from the Kor&#257;n, learnt thus
by heart and chanted in a high sing-song key. There were
no girls. Boys alone are taught anything; and in general
their education begins and ends, as above, with the Kor&#257;n.
Few Moors can write or read: there are no books in
Morocco, except the Kor&#257;n and a religious treatise or two,
to tempt them to learn. As for geography, an intelligent
Moor will know by name England, France, and Germany,
not Russia, and that his own country is the biggest, the
best, and the most powerful.</p>

<p>Leaving the noisy little school, which did not approve
of being stared at, we came to the empty palace, with its
great horse-shoe doorway, painted blue-white and carved
in a rudimentary way, called in Arabic "The little garden,"
descriptive of its inside courtyard, planted with oranges,
figs, and palms.</p>

<p>Farther on stands the forge of the fortress: "for the
slippers for the horses," Hadj Riffi explained. The blacksmith
wore an apron of a whole goat-skin; he pared down
the hoof with an instrument like a shovel, helped by the
horse's owner or any chance onlooker, for Moors "hunt
in packs," and only a mere Christian does anything by
himself. The shoe is a complete circle of iron, has three
nails on each side, and in some places a bar across the
centre.</p>

<p>At last we reached the prison, the principal feature of
the Kasbah. Much has been written about Moorish
prisons, to be put down by ignorant critics as exaggerated.
English visitors have shown up their horrors, only to
be forbidden now by a stringent order to go inside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
It is hard to say what happens behind the scenes, but
torture is lightly thought of in Morocco; "cruelty," as
Europeans understand it, has no place nor meaning in
ignorant, fanatical minds; and an unpleasant inference
is therefore to be drawn.</p>

<p>Of course many of the prisoners are confined, in all
good faith, for offences, and will be released in time;
but there are also Moors, in high positions socially,
or possessed formerly of means, who "wither and agonize"
year after year in captivity, their only fault that they
were rich or influential in bygone days, thus tempting
a jealous rival to remove them out of his path, or a
greedy Government to confine them and feed upon their
money. If they ever come out, it will be because a
wealthy friend has chosen to pay the Government for their
release, or because it has happened to occur to the
ministers at Court to send for them; and half of them
will reappear but scarred remnants of the men who
went in. Descriptions of tortures which were unknown
even in the Middle Ages in England may well be omitted:
tortures which result in blind and tongueless creatures,
without hands; bled of every penny they once possessed,
and maimed in order to induce them to reveal the spot
where their money was hidden, or the friends' names
with whom they traded.</p>

<p>We looked in through a small iron grating in the
door about two feet square, revealing a space open to
the skies, with roofed recesses in the walls round the
four sides, where the prisoners had huddled themselves
in their rags. At night they are chained by the leg.
An Oriental does not require "a bed," but he is provided
with no substitute in prison, still less with food and drink,
for which he is dependent on friends or relations willing
to supply him. Of late years, in certain prisons, a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
loaf of bread per day is given to each man. He has the
great advantage of being able to talk all day to his fellow-prisoners;
but in the case of a refined man such close
intercourse has its drawbacks, more especially when
a raving lunatic happens to be chained by an iron
collar round his neck to one of the pillars. Madmen
and all alike, without respect of persons, veritably rot
to death, cheek by jowl, in a Moorish prison. Disease,
starvation, and injuries tend to shorten their captivity.
Whoever has smelt the smell within those walls will
endorse the adjective "kindly" Death, than which there
surely can be no more welcome visitor.</p>

<p>A few of the sound prisoners, sitting on the ground,
were weaving baskets, some of which we bought through
the keeper of the prison; then turned away, struck by the
stoicism among the prisoners themselves in a situation
of such uncertainty. Was it to end in death or release?
Who knows? They merely shrug their shoulders, and
ejaculate, "Ift shallah" (God will show).</p>

<p>Passing the soldiers guarding the outside of the prison,
and out under a second gateway of the Kasbah, we
stumbled down what is called one of the Sultan's "highways,"
something very rocky and not far off the
perpendicular. R. chose her own feet, much to Hadj
Riffi's annoyance. Though the ways are such that
no donkey can be ridden without stumbling among
cobble-stones and pitfalls, and thereby running a risk
of pitching the rider off the insecure pack into a refuse-heap,
it was impossible for a European, in his eyes,
to walk and to maintain his dignity at the same time.</p>

<p class="sc">Two Sheikhs.</p>

<p>That no Moor runs when he can walk, or walks when
he can ride, or stands when he can sit, or sits when he
can lie down, is a saying fulfilled to the letter. And what
poor man, however heavily he loads his small donkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
with garden produce, forgoes mounting himself on top
of all, and making the little beast stagger along, at a
fair pace too, to market? The life of such a man is
not eventful, but what there is of it is good: he sings
as he jogs along in a monotonous tone, and has a word
for every soul he meets, and a laugh too, curses his donkey&mdash;he
is never quiet&mdash;and lands the produce of his little
melon-patch in the market. The melons are sold by
degrees, much gossip is interspersed, possibly he washes
and prays, then eats, and sleeps a little; more gossip,
until the sun tells him it is time to get outside the city
gates; and then off he jogs again, singing, talking, back
to the little reed-thatched hut, fenced in by its hedge
of cactus. Life is too full of&mdash;call it resignation or
content&mdash;to leave room for disturbing speculations, and
he is born of a race which never repines: there is Allah
and the One Faith, and the sun to lie down beneath
and meditate and sleep. Not that the typical countryman
is idle&mdash;far from it: he is hard-working, without any
beer to do it upon.</p>

<p>It is a matter of more speculation as to what the
courteous, solemn men, in turbans like carved snow, whom
one meets walking along the beach telling their beads,
or sees sitting in sunshine reading aloud in a low voice,
steadily praising Allah, occupy themselves with from
month to month; or the sleek sheikh&mdash;a countryman
of some means, with smooth coffee-coloured face and a
haik whiter than an iced birthday cake&mdash;perched between
the peaks of his red cloth saddle, under which his hard,
hammer-headed mule paces at an intermittent amble.</p>

<p>Probably the sheikh has ridden out of the city to
inspect his crops. His house, with his wife, he has locked
up: the keys are in his pocket. He swings along a
sandy track bordered with cactus, reaches his garden door,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
which is painted Reckitt's blue, unlocks it, and, tying
his mule up inside to a fruit-tree, proceeds to inspect
his vines and prune casually some of the ashy-white
branches of his fig-trees. Then he sets two ragged countrywomen
to work to cut his vines and hoe his beans. He
may read a few verses of the Kor&#257;n later on. He may
sleep. Eventually he ambles home. Other days he spends
among his friends in the city, sitting in their little shops
and gossiping consumedly. He may hire an empty shop
of his own for the same purpose, and turn it into what
might be called "a club." He will pray regularly; will
play chess and draughts sitting in the front of a shop;
will drink green tea. Whatever he does is done without
haste, and towards evening he strolls serenely, with many
interruptions, in the direction of his own house.</p>

<p>The climate of Morocco has never any of the brisk,
freezing "grip" of a hard English winter, but rather tends
towards encouraging indolence. In Tangier itself energetic
English visitors find little superabundant scope for
action: naturally enough, the residents, whom an enervating
summer or two shears of much of the vitality with
which they first landed, end in settling down into an
enjoyable, mild routine. There is, however, shooting and
a little pig-sticking for who will; but guns may not be
brought into the country, and no European would be
allowed to exploit its <i>nullahs</i>: if not killed, he would
be turned back and escorted into trodden ways.</p>

<p>The principal day's excursion from Tangier is out to
Cape Spartel and back again: before we left the place
we started early one morning with this end in view,
taking a donkey and boy carrying a camera, lunch, etc.&mdash;first
along a cobbled roadway of which Tangier is
immensely proud, across the river by a new bridge, and
up the Mountain. The Mountain is the summer abode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
of Tangier, and shady houses and gardens civilize what
was once a wild hill, in the days when our great British
minister, Sir John Hay, did an unprecedented thing, and
built himself a house there.</p>

<p>Forty years ago no Christian was safe outside Tangier
without a guard, and it is largely to Sir John Hay's
fearless trust in the honour of the Moor that the change
is due. It may still be unwise to walk in lonely places
after dark, or to become involved in a street row; for if
one ruffian is excited to throw a stone, thirty will follow
suit, and Europeans have thus been stoned to death.
But those who live out in the Mountain and visitors to
Spartel have nothing to fear in these days in the shape
of attack and robbery.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock when we left behind us the
leggy remains of a Roman aqueduct over the river, and,
having climbed the Mountain, broke into open ground,
stretching far away at the top. The cobbled road resolved
itself into an unsophisticated path; the stiff cane fences,
shutting out all but the tree-tops in the gardens from
view, came to an end; and we were in a breeze off the
Atlantic, on undulating hills covered with short scrub,
gum-cistus, arbutus, tall white heather, oleander, and pink-and-white
convolvulus.</p>

<p>The track led us up and down, and grew more stony
as we went on, gradually rising, till we were about a
thousand feet above the sea. Looking back, Tangier lay
far below, and beyond it in the distance white cragged
mountains glinted in the sun.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day, November 24: a fresh breeze,
tempered as it so seldom is in England at that time of
year. Our path wound round the hills and dipped towards
the sea. From the stretches of heather through which we
brushed we could hear below us the surf breaking on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
rocks: it might have been a corner of the west coast of
Scotland.</p>

<p>After eight miles' up-and-down tramp, the lighthouse at
the end of the great cape, Spartel, the north-west corner
of the African Continent, came into sight. This lighthouse
was built at the instigation of the eleven Powers,
but actually by the Sultan. The Powers&mdash;Great Britain,
France, Germany, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Portugal,
Italy, Russia, America, and Brazil&mdash;share the cost of its
maintenance, and that of the whole road from Tangier
to the lighthouse, which follows the line of telegraph-posts,
the cable being laid to Spartel. The lighthouse is French
built; its fixed intermittent white light can be seen thirty-six
miles away, and it stands 312 feet above sea-level.</p>

<p>Sitting down at its base, looking out to sea, we watched
the black spines of rock underneath us, set in whirlpools
of foam&mdash;the Dark Continent showing the last of its teeth.
On our left the coast trended away into the hazy distance:
to our right across the blue Straits lay the yellow sands
of the bay where Trafalgar was fought, and the irregular
little town of Tarifa, backed by purple Spanish hills.</p>

<p>The evenings were short, and we were soon on our
homeward way. The stunted bushes on each side of
the path, disturbed by the devastating woodcutters, could
hardly hold a lion in the present day. Yet in the course
of Sir John Hay's forty odd years of administration in
Morocco two were seen in these same woods, and he
shot there himself a striped <i>Hy&aelig;na rufus</i>, a great shaggy
animal with a bristling mane. One of the two lions
ought to have been shot, but he doubled back, and was
heard of afterwards travelling at a swinging trot between
Tangier and Tetuan. He killed an ox in the valley
the next day, and disappeared in the direction of the snow-topped
mountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
In this twentieth century lions in the north of Morocco
would be a rare sight: towards the south the mountain-fastnesses
hold them still, together with leopards, wild
cats, etc.; but, like everywhere else, big game moves off
as civilization moves on.</p>

<p>There remains the wild boar. The Moors hunt him
with greyhounds, Europeans shoot him, and Englishmen
have introduced pig-sticking. The largest pig Sir John
Hay speared scaled twenty stone clean, and measured
six foot four from snout to tail. But even pig are getting
scarce. The Tent Club in Tangier organizes expeditions,
and parties go out under canvas for a few days at a time:
the result is nothing very great.</p>

<p>When it is a question of shooting pig, the Moors,
born sportsmen, join one and all&mdash;small farmers and
peasants&mdash;purely from the love of sport. Some act as
beaters, wearing leathern aprons and greaves&mdash;such as
the Greek peasantry wore&mdash;to protect their legs. They
carry bill-hooks to cut their way through the thickets, and
bring along a tribe of native dogs, which do good service&mdash;a
cross between a collie and a jackal, veteran poachers,
which prowl through the scrub, winding a boar at any
distance. The thickets where pig lie are for the most
part backed by the sea, and bordered by lake and marsh
or plain, in which case it is not difficult to inveigle the
driven boar to break where the guns are posted. A
haunch of wild pig judiciously roasted, with a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i>
of wine in the gravy, is one of the delicacies of Morocco.
As many as fifteen boars have been accounted for in a
couple of days' shooting.</p>

<p>The sun went down; the soft air grew colder: we walked
quickly back through the outskirts of Tangier, between
gardens full of plumbago, dituria, geraniums, hibiscus,
pointsettias, narcissus, frescia, and roses of all sorts, besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
other flowers. Anything would grow in a soil which
has been known to bear three crops of potatoes in one
year, and where corn is sometimes sown and reaped all
within the space of forty days.</p>

<p>An enterprising English market-gardener is this year
growing vegetables and fruit for the London market,
expecting to have green peas in Covent Garden in
December, the duty on peas and tomatoes having been
lowered to 5 per cent. This man acts as agent to a
land-owner. Fortunes, indeed, might be made, if it were
not a question of <span class="smcap">find the land</span>; for while land cannot
now be bought in Morocco by Europeans, the few fortunates
who own inherited acres price them high, and,
hoping for a boom in the course of the next fifteen years,
demand &pound;400 an acre.</p>

<p>As we turned into the Villa Valentina a wonderful
opal light warmed the white city and the sand-hills&mdash;they
were no longer cold nor <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'colourness'">colourless</ins>; while banks of "rose"
sunset-clouds were reflected "rose" in a grey-green sea.</p>

<p>Tangier has two sides to it&mdash;one native, the other
European. The European side is all which appears on
the surface, and it swamps the other. Given each of the
eleven Powers, with its minister, its minister's family, its
secretary, its attach&eacute;, its interpreter, its student; add
to these a handful of English residents, a handful of
English and American visitors, and a handful of varied
nationalities thrown in; back them up with the necessary
foundation of purveyors, and lower down still a substratum
of leeches and black-sheep, greedy Jews, needy Spaniards,
introducing drink and tobacco and gambling,&mdash;and there
you have before you all the elements of a highly civilized
town on the Mediterranean shore. It may be Tangier:
it is not Morocco.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-05.png"><img src="./images/ill-05_th.png" alt="TANGIER." title="TANGIER." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Tangier.</p>

<p>The Moorish aristocracy themselves speak of the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
as "Christian-ridden Tangier," and will have none of it:
the Sultan says it "no longer belongs to him." Its trade
is <i>nil</i>, and what there is of it is in the hands of the Jews,
who boast eleven synagogues, schools, and a Grand Rabbi
at the head of all.</p>

<p>We brought introductions with us to various people,
and met with every hospitality in Tangier. Sir Arthur
and Lady Nicolson, representing Great Britain, do all in
their power for visitors; and the colony of mixed nationalities
fills its off hours together, most successfully, with
a round of picnics, afternoon rides, tea parties, and other
amusements, implied by "wintering at Tangier"; from
all of which any knowledge of Morocco, or association
with Moors, is far removed indeed.</p>

<p>A seaport which has neither roads nor railways to
connect it with the surrounding country, is isolated a
week's journey from the nearest capital town, and whose
links with the outer world all tend seawards through
steamers to foreign countries, can never constitute a
study of the land to which it belongs only by right of
position.</p>

<p>But Morocco itself had brought us to the north of
Africa. Tangier could only be a base for future operations,
and consequently a fortnight of Tangier sufficed,
finding us bent upon moving on, before the heavy rains
broke, and the swollen rivers made travelling impossible.
Travelling in Morocco is never at the best of times
luxurious. "Say explore, rather than travel," somebody
writes, speaking of Morocco; and many were the injunctions
and warnings which the post brought us from
friends at home&mdash;above all, to expect no ransoms, in the
event of capture by lawless tribes.</p>

<p>It is true that a <i>Wanderjahr</i> in Morocco has not the
luxuries of travel in India; and Englishmen who would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
break new ground must wear Moorish dress, talk Arabic,
and prepare to face considerable risks, with the off-chance
of writing in some such strain as Davidson: "To-day
I have parted with all my hair except one long tuft
over my right ear. I never expect to become white
again. My beard is very long. My legs covered with
bites of vermin. My cheek-bones prominent, and my
teeth sharp from having very little to do."</p>

<p>Not that R. and myself had such adventures in view;
but we believed that even as humble followers in the
tracks of others we should find no lack of interest in
a country so little known, among a people of "The Arabian
Nights," under conditions which tempt the Unexpected
to stalk out from behind every corner.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Tetuan</i>&mdash;the tiger-cat! so curiously beautiful. Recollections of
it hang in the gallery of one's memory, not so much as pictures,
but as Correggio-like masses of vivid colouring and intangible
spirals of perfume.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> place we had set our hearts upon visiting, to
begin with, was the northern capital, Fez&mdash;only
to find, on going into particulars, that insurmountable
barriers blocked the way. Even if we escaped the
December rains on the ride there, they would break
sooner or later, making sleeping out under canvas impossible:
the flooded rivers might mean a long delay&mdash;probably
a week or more&mdash;on the banks; bridges in
Morocco are harder to find than diamonds on the seashore,
and when a river is in flood there remains only to sit down
in front of it until the waters abate.</p>

<p>The "road" to Fez, after the tropical rains, soon becomes
a slough of clay and water, ploughed up by mules
and donkeys, and so slippery that nothing can keep its legs.
We decided, therefore, to leave Fez till the spring, when
the rains would be over, and to visit for the present a
city called Tetuan, only two days' journey from Tangier,
camping out as long as we felt inclined, and returning
to the Villa Valentina in a week, or when the weather
should drive us back. But the gods thought otherwise.</p>

<p>Tetuan was, by report, in the most beautiful part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
Morocco: its situation reminded travellers of Jerusalem;
it was among the Anjera and Riff Mountains; and though,
of course, travel was impossible within the forbidden land
of the Riff, it was likely we should gather some interesting
crumbs of information, and come across a few of the famous
tribesmen, while we were staying on the borders. Above
all, it was a Moorish city, and counted an aristocratic one
at that: no European element spoilt its originality. On
the face of it Tetuan had attractions.</p>

<p>Accordingly we made preparations to be off.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to get hold of a man
who could cook, act as guide, interpreter, and muleteer:
plenty of them presented themselves, and we closed with
a certain Mohammed, who had been with Colonel H&mdash;&mdash;.
Every third Moor is named Mohammed, or some corruption
of it&mdash;eldest sons invariably.</p>

<p>Next we ransacked Tangier for commissariat and
camp outfit. Out of a dirty little Spanish shop two men's
saddles of antiquated English make, with rolls, were unearthed,
and hired in preference to some prehistoric side-saddles,
with moth-eaten doe-skin seats and horned third
pommels.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-06.png"><img src="./images/ill-06_th.png" alt="TETUAN." title="TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Tetuan.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><i>Photo by A. Cavilla, Tangier.</i></p>

<p>Then we obtained a permit from the English Consul,
for the sum of seven-and-sixpence, authorizing us to apply
to the governor of the Kasbah for one of the Moorish
soldiers quartered in Tangier, who should act as our escort
to Tetuan. The Sultan of Morocco undertakes to protect
British subjects travelling in his dominions as far as
possible, provided they supply themselves with an adequate
escort and avoid roads through unsafe territory.
The various tribes from among themselves sometimes
provide an armed guard to see travellers safely across
their own country, handing them on at the borders to the
next tribe, who sends its mounted escort to meet them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
The headman arranges for the safety of Europeans, and
his tribe answers for their lives. But this plan involves
prearrangement, publicity, and fuss. Now from Tangier
to Tetuan the road by daylight is perfectly safe&mdash;though
it happens that, at the time of writing, the body of a
peasant, presumably out after sunset, has been found
robbed and murdered close to it. Therefore one soldier
was all we should want; and at last this bodyguard was
supplied, a ragged Moor, with a lean mule and a French
rifle&mdash;all for five shillings per day.</p>

<p>We next visited a general "stores," lined with the
familiar Cadbury, Keiller, and Huntley &amp; Palmer tins:
there we invested in corned beef, tinned soup, potted
meats, cheese, salt, macaroni, marmalade, tea, coffee, sugar,
candles, soap, matches, etc. Things not to be forgotten
were nails, hammer, rope, methylated spirit and etna. A
revolver for its moral effect is necessary, and may be
invaluable in a tight corner. We provided ourselves with
two tents, one for the servants and a larger one for
ourselves; a set of camp furniture, including kitchen pots
and pans; and an enamel breakfast and dining service,
which, if time had mattered little, would have been well
exchanged for an aluminium set out from England, as
lighter and more convenient.</p>

<p>Mohammed hired four mules and another man&mdash;Ali&mdash;himself
taking charge of the cooking department, providing
meat, bread, vegetables, fruit, etc.: then with our
<i>bundobust</i> complete, and a letter of introduction from
Sir Arthur Nicolson to the British Vice-Consul at Tetuan,
we started on November 28.</p>

<p>It was one of the hottest mornings we had had, not
a fleck of cloud in the sky, and what air there was due
east: the sea lay flat as a blue pool, and five or six
white sails might have been swans on its glassy surface.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
Mohammed appeared early in the sandy road underneath
our windows. To avoid waking people in the hotel, we
handed our diminutive kit out through the window to him&mdash;only
a couple of waterproof rolls, which held rugs and bare
necessities; then locking up the bulk of our worldly goods
behind us, slipped out of the Villa Valentina, mounted
our mules, and were off across the white sand-dunes
bordering the sea.</p>

<p>Tetuan lies forty-four miles to the south-east of Tangier:
people with much time and little energy have made a
three days' march of it. A range of hills rather more
than half-way makes a natural division, and on the
top of this watershed a <i>fond&acirc;k</i> (caravanserai) stands for
the use of travellers during the night: here it is usual
to camp.</p>

<p>We were an odd little procession as we left Tangier.
Our mounted soldier, Cadour, led the way, in a brown
weather-worn jellab, which he pulled right up over his
head like a Franciscan friar: his legs were bare, his feet
thrust into a pair of old yellow shoes. He carried his
gun across his saddle in front of him, inside one arm: it
was in a frayed brown canvas case, which had holes in
each end, out of which both stock and barrel respectively
protruded. With his other hand he jogged incessantly
at the mule's mouth. Take him all in all, a soldier's
was the last trade he outwardly impersonated. Behind
him rode R. and myself, shaking down by degrees
into our saddles, glad not to have before us eight or
ten hours' jog across rough country on provincial side-saddles,
which, apart from the strained position, are inconvenient
for slipping off and on again. Behind us followed
the two baggage-mules with our tents, etc.: loaded as
they were, Mohammed and Ali had climbed upon the tops
of their great packs. A mule carries as much as he can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
get along under in Morocco: the man climbs up afterwards,
and does not count.</p>

<p>Two hundredweight, with a Moor on top, is a fair load
for a long journey, marching seven hours every day.
Enough barley should be carried for each night's fodder:
the ordinary mule and pony live on barley and broken
straw, beans when in season, and grass in the spring to
fatten them. Sevenpence a day will feed a mule, and
hire comes to three shillings a day. Good mules are not
bought easily, and are worth, on account of their toughness,
more than ponies, fetching &pound;12 any day. Ours were but
second-rate hirelings, and we made up our minds to buy
later on, when starting on a long expedition. A mule
should be chosen chiefly for its pacing powers, doing
four and a half miles an hour on an average for seven
hours a day, without turning a hair or tiring the rider,
whose comfort depends on an easy pace. The longer the
overlap of the hind-shoe print over the fore-shoe print,
the better the pace. Moorish horses are wiry little beasts,
but you seldom see a handsome one: either they are
ewe-necked or they fall away in the hindquarters; their
feet are allowed to grow too long, and their legs are ruined
through tight hobbling. Nor is there much inducement to
a Moor to breed a handsome foal, liable to be stolen from
him, if seen by a governor or agent of the Sultan's.
Naturally he breeds the inferior animal he has a chance
of keeping, and puts a valuable mare to a common stallion,
branding and otherwise disfiguring a colt which by bad
luck turns out good-looking.</p>

<p>The slender desert-horse, the <i>habb-er-reeh</i> (gust of
wind, as they call him), with the small aristocratic head,
a nose which will go into a tea-cup, perfect shoulders,
and diminutive sloping hindquarters, is seldom met
with and hardly ever used, except quite in the south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
of the country, where he is given camel's milk to
drink.</p>

<p>People as a rule start off on their day's march with the
dawn, after a light breakfast of coffee, beaten-up eggs, and
dry biscuits; halt about ten o'clock, supposing they are
near water; and, if necessary, do two or three hours more,
comfortably, before sunset. But we had made a late start,
and the sun was far up as we jogged along one after
the other, leaving behind the sands, the orange gardens,
and the gimcrack Spanish houses, at every step the open
country widening in front of us.</p>

<p>We followed a narrow path, one of the countless footpaths
which zigzag in and out, and wind away to every
point of the compass, like ants' tracks from an ant-hill.
Donkeys, mules, countrywomen, eternally pass and re-pass
along the polished ways, with the everlasting burdens
of charcoal, faggots, vegetables, and flour: life in some
form moving along them there always is.</p>

<p>Towards the edge of the horizon, clumps of dwarf
palm and coarse grass slanted in the breeze: here and
there grey rocks stuck up on the hillside like fossilized
bones, and met the blue sky. A stream was meandering,
hidden under deep banks, on our right. We wound along
the wide valley, doing our best to keep the mules going
at a respectable pace, and finding that there was quite
an art in accomplishing it on a hireling. Cadour cut in
behind, and supplemented our sticks and heels with Arabic
words of much effect, his own mule's mouth suffering
badly from his jogging, remorseless hand.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-07.png"><img src="./images/ill-07_th.png" alt="OURSELVES AND BAGGAGE." title="OURSELVES AND BAGGAGE." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Ourselves and Baggage.</p>

<p>A raven, "a blot in heaven, flying high," sailed over
our heads up in the blue, and then, leisurely dropping,
sat on a rock and croaked at us. Morocco is a country
of circling kites and keen-eyed hawks, whose easy, buoyant
flight and vibrating "hover" in the hot air are things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
of undying fascination. Now and again a puff of east
wind&mdash;life-giving&mdash;would stir the whole countryside and
pass on, leaving us glowing under a sun which warmed
every cranny, and made the section of air just above
the flat fields rock with heat. Two countrywomen toiled
towards us under their bundles&mdash;a couple of figures
swathed in yellowy white; they gazed at us as people
gaze who have few interests in their lives, then smiled
and spoke, gesticulated, and laughed again: a herd of
goats was outlined on the hill above; the goat-herd
called to another far-off brown-clad figure, and the
echoes filtered down to us: a rabbit dashed up out of
a palm-bush and scuttled away: and then there was
silence profound, and we paced on eastwards, talking
and singing a song sometimes, while the sun climbed
right-handed.</p>

<p>There is no life like it&mdash;that life of the open air and
its absolute freedom. Monotonous it would certainly be
to many people: small and uneventful matters, and a
palette set in greys and browns, charm but a few, for
whom solitary rides and waste places are "things in
common," and chance meetings and little incidents by
the way suffice.</p>

<p>Two or three miles outside Tangier stretch rich
undulating lands between low hills: a few divisionless
fields bear witness to both primitive and erratic farming,
and give that regretful air to the landscape which land
not "done well by" always imparts.</p>

<p>The writer has lately read a somewhat pessimistic
letter upon the state of Morocco. Morocco is a decadent
empire, it is true: primarily, because the two races to
whom the country belongs live, and have always lived
from time immemorial, under a tribal system; and
secondarily, because those same races, Arab and Berber,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
hate one another with a racial hatred. These two
reasons by themselves augur badly for the land they
live upon, implying a state of armed neutrality, no
cohesion, and no settled peace.</p>

<p>Under a tribal system the tribe is the unit, not the
individual&mdash;"one for all, and all for one": it follows
that transgression and retribution are both upon a
wholesale scale, and alike disastrous towards the consolidation
of a united nation.</p>

<p>The government in a country cursed by the tribal
system must in the very nature of things be despotic:
lawless tribes need the tyrant's hand of iron. To the
fact of his being a despot the Sultan owes his security,
coupled with one other reason. Arabs and Berbers
alike are fanatics: religion is the air they breathe, the
salt of life. The Sultan is descended direct from the
One Great Prophet; consequently the Sultan is acknowledged
as lord. His policy is an Oriental one: tribe
is played off against tribe, one European power against
the other European power; the empire is isolated;
innovations are prohibited, lest European civilization
should oust Moorish eccentricities. So much for the
Oriental policy of "the balance of jealousies."</p>

<p>Despotism breeds despotism. While every Moor below
the Sultan ranks as equal, the fact remains that Government
officials are all in their own sphere little despots,
governing districts many days' journey from Court, with
every chance of robbing and oppressing those under
them, until the day of reckoning comes, when the Court,
hearing how fat their fine bird has grown, summons him
to the capital, and the process of plucking and imprisoning
their wealthy servant follows.</p>

<p>Life exists upon life, from the <i>sheikhs</i> (farmers), who
live upon what they can squeeze out of the peasants, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
the <i>bashas</i> (governors), who exist on tithes, taxes, and
extortion wrung from the sheikhs and townspeople, up
to higher officials, who receive no salaries, and line their
pockets by a process of bleeding the bashas and
others . . . . . . thus <i>ad lib</i>. Even the gaolers&mdash;also
unpaid&mdash;earn their living by extorting money from the
prisoners. The whole system of government reacts
upon itself; for the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'venalty'">venality</ins> of the officials drives the
tribes to redress their wrongs at intervals by raids and
open rebellion, to punish whom there follows slaughter
upon slaughter, and the country is laid waste.</p>

<p>Hence the principal reasons&mdash;wheels within wheels&mdash;which
account for the Morocco of 1902: its prehistoric
customs, its uncultivated acres.</p>

<p>No reformer, no missionary, will alter the condition
of Morocco. The Moors themselves have made it what
it is; but since for an Ethiopian to change his skin is
no light matter, there is small probability of the Moors
themselves unmaking it.</p>

<p>A gloomy prospect, yet one which, taking the case
of the people and looking upon it from a "happiness"
point of view, must not be altogether judged from a
European standpoint. The likes and dislikes of Moors
are not the likes and dislikes of Europeans, and most
of them view their good times and bad times with equal
calm, as merely the will of Allah. Besides which, anything
in the shape of law and order and daily routine rasps
their raw nature. Just as a Moor prefers to eat to
repletion when there is food, and to go without when
there is not, so he would choose a desultory and irresponsible
life, alternating between perfect freedom and
excessive tyranny, to any regular humdrum form of
government which Europe could offer him.</p>

<p>The country people we met, if hard-worked, had at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
the same time cheerful enough faces: their enjoyment
of life probably equals that of the English labourer.</p>

<p>On the whole, it is possible that, when the day comes&mdash;as
it must come&mdash;that an effete and inadequate people
goes to the wall, and civilized blood occupies their room,
it may bring good, but that good will be tinged with
regret&mdash;certainly in the eyes of those selfish mortals to
whom one country, neither wire-fenced nor scored by
railways, nor swept nor garnished, but coloured to-day by
the smoke of many thousand years, still offers palmy days.
Thus giving thanks to Allah for things as they are, after
the manner of the country, we jogged along, looking out
for a halting-ground: it was between twelve and one
o'clock, and time to stretch our legs.</p>

<p>The river and some oleander-bushes, with green lawns
between them, offered all we wanted. Cadour took off
his brown jellab, and spread it for us to sit upon. There
we lunched and waited for an hour. Some oxen were
ploughing close to us, driven in a desultory way by a
figure clad in a pair of once white drawers, and a once
white tunic with a leather belt. All which this husbandman
wanted being corn enough to supply himself, and
no surplus to fall into the sheikh's hands, the field was
naturally small. A well-to-do farmer might rise to growing
a little maize or cummin or millet or fenugreek for exportation,
perhaps some broad-beans, chick-peas, or canary-seed;
but the duties are heavy. Wheat and barley have
been forbidden export: the infidel shall not eat bread of
the true believer's corn.</p>

<p>Our Arabic at that time was <i>nil</i>; there was no chance
of a word with the ploughman unless through Mohammed.
Such a mere scratch of a furrow as he made, into which
the grain would be casually thrown, with never a harrow
or substitution for one! Allah provides, and there is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
reason to interfere with his arrangements: "B`ism Allah."
Thus will the fields be reaped, the corn ground, the bread
made, the loaf eaten, with the same old invocation muttered
beforehand: "B`ism Allah" (In the name of God).</p>

<p>The two little oxen drew the patriarchal plough, hewn
out of a log of wood, and shod with an iron point, entirely
by means of their heads, to which it was fastened with
dried grass-fibres across their foreheads and round their
horns, making a sort of large straw bonnet on top of
all which they held high in the air or sideways, with expressions
of extreme disgust. In the middle of the field,
yoked by the bonnet to a second plough and a fellow-ox,
the companion had inconsiderately lain down, to the great
inconvenience of its foolish partner, which remained
standing, with its head forced into the most unpleasant
angle downwards, and the stoical expression of a true
Mussulman underneath its bonnet.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the stream some sheep, suggestive
of the lean, tough mutton we fed upon, were
searching round for anything in the shape of pasture:
flocks of small cows and calves were on the same quest
between the palmetto-bushes: somewhere a boy in charge
was no doubt asleep.</p>

<p>By this time Mohammed was impatient to be off: the
bits were put back into the mules' mouths, we got into our
saddles again, and pushed on. In wet weather the track
must be a bad one to follow: innumerable streamlets,
which have eaten out deep gullies in the clay, have to be
crossed, making the going hard upon heavily laden beasts,
and after heavy rains impossible. We slipped about a
little. Mohammed and his man had their hands full with
the two baggage-mules, which they had long ago given up
trying to ride. The slopes became more bleak: far away
in the distance Cadour pointed out our destination, a white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
speck on the top of a range of hills, to be seen for a
moment and lost sight of the next, as we dipped down
on to lower ground. Another hour brought it very little
nearer: fresh irregularities between opened up continually,
meaning <i>d&eacute;tours</i> to the right or left. A few plover wailed
over some marsh: in such places partridge, hares, golden
grouse, and quail ought to be found; but since every male
possesses a gun of sorts, from the peasant hoeing beans
upwards, and is not troubled with game laws or ideas
upon preserving, they become rarer.</p>

<p>We passed clump after clump of white narcissus in full
bloom, and marigolds in yellow patches; but as we neared
the hills the country grew wilder, and short scrub, palmetto,
and cistus took the place of coarse grass.</p>

<p>At last we were at the foot of the pass, and the end of
our march was all uphill, steep in places, the scrub turning
into respectable bushes, with almost a "jungly" aspect.
The baggage-mules were pushed and urged ahead. At
last, about five o'clock, the sun setting, we reached our
camping-ground, up in the teeth of a rising wind.</p>

<p>Standing by itself, the caravanserai&mdash;called a <i>fond&acirc;k</i> in
Morocco&mdash;was a white-walled enclosure, with a great open
space in the middle and colonnades all round the insides
of the four walls, where men and mules huddled and slept
unconcernedly. There is also one room to be had; but
filthy, of course, such quarters always are, and dear at any
price (the rate for accommodation is not large). One look
into the walled enclosure, crowded with transport animals
and their drivers, was enough, and we turned to see to the
pitching of the tents outside.</p>

<p>The panorama of hills in the west had a red, lurid light,
such as Julius Ollsson loves to paint: across the stormy
glow trailed a few white wisps of smoke where the peasants
were burning wood on the hillside for charcoal. Making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> of the fond&acirc;k while there was light to see, we
chose the west side for our camp, apparently the most
sheltered; but the place is a temple of the four winds and
gusty upon a breathless day.</p>

<p>It was quite dark before the men had things ready,
hampered as they were by the gale which was getting
up and the want of light. We tried to keep warm, and
watched the first star come out from a knoll; at last took
refuge in our wind-shaken tent, unpacked, and sat ourselves
down with outstretched legs, wrapped in a medley
of garments, round the little camp-table, lit by the flicker
of two candle-lanterns, the flaps of the tents snugly
fastened together from within, awaiting Mohammed's first
culinary effort.</p>

<p>By-and-by from out of the chaotic kitchen-tent, pitched
in the dark, filled with confused commissariat, and further
blocked by Cadour, Ali, and their small effects, Mohammed
emerged, and handed in through an opening in our tent
chicken and eggs cooked in Moorish fat. After a long
interval tea followed, and fruit. We sat listening to the
wind, writing up a diary and talking till bed seemed
the best and only warm place. The gale woke me after
an hour or two: the tent, torn by raging gusts, threatened
to give at every moment. I got up and took a look
outside. A wild, gustful night indeed, of glimmering stars
and a great white half-moon&mdash;cold too: the mountains
stood out sharp; there was little cloud; round our tent
a guard of men from the fond&acirc;k&mdash;always supplied, for the
safety of travellers&mdash;were sleeping on the ground, heads
and all wrapped up in their jellabs,&mdash;the moon shone on
the queer bundles, and on our five mules, picketed opposite
the tent door, backs to the wind, munching their barley.
Neither of us got much sleep; roused periodically by
the hammering in afresh of our strained tent-pegs, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
men's voices, which would relapse into silence for half
an hour, and then break out again; above all, by the
flapping and rattling of the canvas. For a moment there
was a lull, and we heard the mules feeding and the
thousand sounds of the night; then a wild blast almost
carried the tent away, and the monotonous undertone of
voices would begin once more.</p>

<p>We were up early, spent little time over dressing in
a stiff breeze, and turned out to look at the weather.
Banks of cloud lay piled up in the wind, but rain never
comes with the <i>sharki</i> (east wind). The sun was up&mdash;no
chance of seeing it for the present.</p>

<p>Mohammed boiled eggs and tea, and in another twenty
minutes we were ready to quit our exposed camping-ground.</p>

<p>From the fond&acirc;k to Tetuan the distance is only fifteen
miles, half a day's journey. The day before we had done
twenty-eight miles, and ought to have started at dawn,
avoiding the pitching of our tents in the dark. To-day
we were off betimes.</p>

<p>It was cold, and I walked the first hour or two, Cadour
and R. riding behind with my mule, coming slowly
down the steep, rocky ridge into the valley in which
Tetuan lies. It was a bad bit of riding, a continuous
descent, and the baggage-mules fell far behind: the
rocky ravine was uncultivated and treeless, scrub and
rocks only on the bare mountains. Sometimes a crest
would have a saw edge against the sky, suggesting fir
woods; but as a matter of fact every tree worth having
which is not planted by a saint's tomb, and therefore
holy, has long ago been made into fire-wood, no coal
finding its way into the interior of Morocco, and mining
being a thing unknown.</p>

<p>At last the slopes gave on to more level ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
and strips of cultivation: we had our first view of
Tetuan, at that distance little more than a streak of
white lying in the shelter of the hills.</p>

<p>It was better going; and R. having jogged on some
way ahead, I waited for Cadour, climbed into my saddle,
and caught her up. Here and there, perched on each
side of us, far above in the mountains, wherever an
oasis of green lay between sheltering cliffs, a village
had sprung up, an irregular cluster of brown-and-white
huts, thatched with cane, weathered to shades of brown,
the whole pile hedged with grey aloes and cactus, on
the steep mountain-side&mdash;also brown&mdash;where, unless
looked for, they could easily have been passed over
altogether.</p>

<p>These were the only signs of man; for Tetuan shared
the speciality of the fond&acirc;k the night before, in vanishing
behind intervening hills and never growing any nearer.
But the mules this time were fresher, or we had learnt
the art of keeping them up to the mark; they broke into
a canter, and scampered across the rich-looking flats
bordering the river W&aacute;d Mart&icirc;l. The W&aacute;d Mart&icirc;l is
the proud possessor of one of the seven bridges which
the Empire of Morocco can show&mdash;a somewhat quaint
construction, but a <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> stone bridge: no carriage
could have crossed it; the middle cobble-stones were so
steep and rough that they amounted to rocks. But
Morocco knows not carriages, and at least it was a
bridge.</p>

<p>Once across, Tetuan was not more than a few
miles off.</p>

<p>Seen from any height, it is one of the whitest cities
in the world, and the whitewashed walls lend themselves
to flat shadow as blue as the sky above. Tetuan has
been described as "a cluster of flat-backed white mice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
shut up in a fortress in case they should escape": it
has also been likened to Jerusalem, with "the hills round
about." For my own part, it was like nothing I had
seen, nor was prepared then and there to classify&mdash;this
heap of chalk, this white city. Not a particle of smoke
floated over it: purity and sunlight alone were suggested
by the outside of the platter. The Moor has a weakness
for whitewashed houses, for long white garments, for
veiled women: there shall be no outer windows in his
house, nor in his own private life. Ugliness there may
be, enough and to spare, inside these white cities&mdash;it
oozes out sometimes; but as far as possible let a haik
and a blank wall enshroud it all in mystery.</p>

<p>None can fix the age of Tetuan: once upon a time the
city was on the seashore&mdash;now seven miles of flats lie
between, and crawling mules and donkeys link the two,
working backwards and forwards, week in, week out,
jogging down with empty packs to the cargo-steamers,
and labouring back across deep-flooded country half the
year, under solid burdens, to the city. From the flat roof-tops
the weekly visit of a merchant-vessel is duly looked
for, and a long black steamer lies at anchor for the day in
the narrow ribbon of blue sea seen to the east, near the
white Customs House, which stands back from the beach.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-08.png"><img src="./images/ill-08_th.png" alt="CLOUDS OVER TETUAN." title="CLOUDS OVER TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Clouds Over Tetuan.</p>

<p>Southwards Tetuan faces the Riff country, range after
range of mountains, inhabited by that indomitable tribe,
whose "highlands" are closed to Europeans. The river
W&aacute;d Mart&icirc;l, between Tetuan and <i>the Riff</i>, winds across the
seven miles of flats to the sea, and is fordable in two or
three places except in heavy rains; and days "in the
mountains"&mdash;safe within sight of the city&mdash;promised us
many an expedition, and opened up another world of
heights foreshadowed and gulfs forbidden, where the hours
were all too short.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
Behind Tetuan to the north, the mountainous Anjera
country, wild, bare hills abut upon the very city wall.</p>

<p>The name <i>Tetuan</i> means in Arabic "The eyes of the
springs," and all over the city water gushes out of the
limestone rock&mdash;the hardest water, I submit, that ever
mortal tried to drink. Such a supply is worth a kingdom
to an Eastern city. Every tank, fountain, and <i>hummum</i>
(Turkish bath) has its never-failing supply, gratis, from
the heart of the hills. The little streets are watered by it,
and the sewage carried off on the lower side of the city
in a strong current, which&mdash;still useful&mdash;works primitive
corn-mills under the wall on the south side, where a sack
receives the flour from a couple of flat revolving stones.
A miller was robbed the other night asleep by his sack:
the door burst open, and he expected a bullet, but was
let off with a clout on the head and the confiscation of
his sack.</p>

<p>Having ground the corn, sewage and all is conducted
over the land, and enriches the fertile apricot- and peach-orchards,
corn-fields and vineyards. The great orange-gardens
lie beyond in the rich river-deposit. There is no
want of fruit round Tetuan: May sees pomegranates,
apricots, peaches, figs, prickly pears, in due course;
September brings the grape season; acres upon acres of
gardens are covered with green muscats ripening on the
dry ground, and protected from the sun by branches
strewn over the plants.</p>

<p>West of the city, upon which side we rode in, there are
fewer orchards and more fields. Since crossing the W&aacute;d
Mart&icirc;l a string of travellers had caught us up and passed
us: a soldier as escort led the way; a rich Jew ambled
on a fat brown mule hard behind; a muleteer and three
starved mules laden with Isaac's worldly goods brought
up the rear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
The muleteer, a happy fellow in a brown jellab, sang all
the way, as he rode sideways on his beast. He begged a
match from Cadour, produced a ragged cigarette from
inside his turban, and lit it skilfully in the wind: he
probably lived chiefly on cigarettes, kif, and green tea,
eating when there was bread; he was lean and sun-dried as
a shred of tobacco, would sleep in snatches and often, his
jellab-hood over his face to keep off the sun or the dew.</p>

<p>We got very near a pair of snowy <i>ibis</i>, or cow-birds,
as they are called, attending on two grazing cows. White
as geese, parading about on black stilt-like legs, which
raise them a foot or more off the ground, they have
yellow bills and a slightly puffed throat, in flight extending
their long legs behind them. Cow-birds wage war on the
parasites of mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep, hopping
about the fields and dropping down on to their backs:
they are never shot.</p>

<p>Morocco is by no means short of bird life. Only that
morning, as we rode along, we saw several pairs of whinchats,
any number of crested larks, some plover, pied
and grey wagtails, starlings, and a sand-martin. Starlings
in Morocco fly literally in clouds like smoke, blackening
the sky wherever they are surging and wheeling. A single
shot into the middle of a flock has brought down from
sixty to seventy of them.</p>

<p>We jogged up the last yard of rocky path, and found
ourselves in front of Tetuan in rather less than four hours
after leaving the fond&acirc;k, to the satisfaction of Cadour:
it was an improvement on the day before. This ornament
of the cavalry had now come out in a clean white turban,
in view of entering the city: he puzzled us at this point
by leading the way off the road to a white wall in the
middle of the field, behind which travellers occasionally
camp, devout people pray, and sheep are slaughtered at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
time of the Great Feast. Here he produced our luncheon.
But we, in the innocence of our hearts, would "lunch
at a caf&eacute;" in Tetuan, after calling at the British Consulate
and leaving our letters of introduction: this, with signs and
a Spanish word or two, was brought home to Cadour,
and we turned back, skirted the white city wall, reached
a gate built in an angle, and rode in under the archway,
passing a few figures in jellabs reclining and talking
beside a great stone water-trough, which was running
with fresh water.</p>

<p>Following one of the worst-paved streets upon Allah's
earth, whose slippery rocks and pools of brown manure-water
offered no tempting footpath, the first Union Jack
we had seen for many a long day appeared above a wall
and spoke <i>Britain</i>: towards it we made our way. A
soldier in a long dark blue cloak and high-peaked red
fez was sitting at the Consul's office door: he took our
letters of introduction, and, without our being able to
explain ourselves in Arabic, insisted on ushering us
straight into the presence of the Consul&mdash;Mr. W. S.
Bewicke.</p>

<p>We found him surrounded with papers and cigarette-ends:
he would most hospitably take no denial in the
matter of lunch, but made us come into the house at
once. His long, narrow dining-room was flanked by
a small kitchen; above, the same shaped, long, narrow
sitting-room was flanked by a small bedroom; a flight
of narrow, steep stairs divided all four rooms, and completed
the Consulate: this simple plan is usual in a Moorish
house of the sort, and admirably adapted for the Eastern
habits of the people. The Consul considered it inadequate.
A sunny, walled garden lay in front; big orange- and
banana-trees, both covered with fruit, shaded precious
seedlings; a large tank, filled with gold-fish, took up much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
space under the windows; and in the background a high
cane fence penned in turkeys, geese, ducks, and chickens,
scratching and squabbling under orange-trees. There are
no grassy lawns in these gardens: they <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'are are'">are</ins> devoted
to fruit, shrubs, and flowers, bisected into equal divisions
by tiled or grass paths.</p>

<p>People in Morocco, as all the world over, collect curiosities
<i>nolens volens</i>. Mr. Bewicke's dining-room was no
exception. Guns from the Riff, eight feet long; brass
powder-horns, knives, daggers, pistols, engraved and inlaid
with silver, ivory, and coral; a long brass horn, once blown
from the top of the mosque, sacred and difficult to get;
copper vessels, pots, pans, jugs, bowls; blue china from
Fez; quaint Jewish candelabra and lamps; brown and
white native pottery,&mdash;all found a place.</p>

<p>A young Riffian named Mohr acted as butler, a coffee-and-cream-coloured
boy, with a girlish face and a head
with a close weekly shave, all except one long love-lock,
which, combed out, fell over one ear in a glossy brown
curl. It is worn by all Riffs as good Mussulmans, and
serves a double purpose, that of scalp-lock when the head
is decapitated by enemies and borne by the lock instead
of by the mouth, and that of handle, by which Azrael,
the Angel of Death, carries the body to heaven on the
last day. Mohr wore a Riff turban of brown string,
several yards long, wound round and round his head, a
white tunic and belt: his legs were bare; and leaving his
yellow slippers behind him on the threshold, he moved
noiselessly round the table with gracious manners, and,
when he spoke, made nonchalant gestures with his hands.</p>

<p>Had we come a few days earlier, we should have fallen
in with a thousand men from the Beni Has`san tribe, who
had come down to pay their respects to the new <i>basha</i>
(governor) of Tetuan, and to offer him presents.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
They had fired off a good deal of blank powder, and
a stray bullet or two into the Consul's garden door;
had rushed about the <i>feddan</i> (market-place), discharging
their guns; and had thrown stones at some one. On
their way to Tetuan the thousand odd had pillaged
right and left, stealing fruit and robbing houses. Finding
some women washing, they stole the clothes, and report
said two women as well. At last twenty of them were
caught and put into prison, after which the nine hundred
and eighty marched back to their own country.</p>

<p>Lunch over, we walked with Mr. Bewicke into the
city. While Tangier might be called an an&aelig;mic copy
of a Moorish town, Tetuan has the strength of a <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i>
life-study, and all that is curiously beautiful, strangely
obscure, is unsparingly suggested. The longer a European
lives there, the more the paradoxes in Moorish life force
themselves upon him, and the more tangible grow certain
intuitions which his surroundings convey.</p>

<p>It is not only such contradictions as lie on the surface&mdash;the
squalor of some filthy fond&acirc;k, the emaciated
raw-skinned donkeys, the bent-backed women, rubbing
shoulders with the white-scented robes, the sleek mules,
the luxurious tiled houses&mdash;these a blind man could see:
the under-currents which will puzzle an Englishman more
the longer he lives there are known to those only who have
dwelt much in Morocco, and they belong by every right
to a life which is drawn to the letter in "The Arabian
Nights."</p>

<p>The ramifications of the narrow streets in Tetuan would
take a quarter of a lifetime to master, and then an unexplored
alley might be found, though it is easy to walk
across the entire length or breadth of the city in ten
minutes. Down a dozen intricacies we dived with Mr.
Bewicke, through a labyrinth, half dark in places, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
houses built overhead shut out the sun. Looking along
the narrow streets, the buildings jostle one another, and
the flat blank walls slope backwards out of the upright,
at every turn a haphazard colour-scheme in white and
mauve and chocolate, in blue and ochre and cream.</p>

<p>Here a long dark tunnel opens into sunlight and shops
on each side, with great vines trailed on trellis-work&mdash;like
a pergola&mdash;overhead, and sunlight in blotches on
the cobbled paving below: there, just beyond, the <i>Slipper
Quarter</i>, and we find ourselves in the thick of the tap-tap
of the mallets on the hard-hammered leather&mdash;dozens
of busy little shops on each side, lined with yellow matting,
and hung from top to floor with rows of lemon-yellow
slippers for the men, rose-red slippers for women, embroidered
slippers for the wealthy, crimson slippers for
slaves, slippers with heel-pieces and slippers without. In
each shop a man and boys at work: the white turbans
and dark faces bending over the leather, the coloured
jellabs which they wear, the busy hard-white-wood mallets
in the deft brown hands, even the waxed thread, the red
jelly which glues the soles together, the gimlets, the sharp
scissors, have a passing fascination for the wandering
Moor himself, who sits down lazily in front and talks to
the workers. Still more for ourselves. Leather bags
are being sewn next door and ornamented with work
in coloured leather and silks. Within hearing of the
"tap-tap" lies the skin-yard, and the skins are scraped
and tanned and dyed and turned into slippers all in the
same square acre or two, whence they depart many of
them for Egypt and supply the Cairo bazaars.</p>

<p>A few steps farther, and there is a steady clanking of
hammers on anvils, beating out hot iron&mdash;the <i>Blacksmiths'
Quarter</i>. Not the old turbaned blacksmiths nor boys
with shaved heads, in tunics grimed with age, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
leather aprons sewn with red leather, nor the primitive
bellows and quaint iron points, all being beaten out
for the ploughs, are the features of the Blacksmiths'
Quarter; but the sheep. Every forge has its sheep,
every shop its pen like a rabbit-hutch, made out of the
side of a box, where the sheep lives when it is not lying
just at the threshold of the shop in the sun, beside a
half-finished meal of bran in a box. Sheep after sheep,
tame and fat, take up half the room in the street: there
are sometimes a few hens, often a tortoiseshell cat curled
up on a sack, but to every shop there is always a sheep
fattening, as no other animal in Morocco fattens, against
the <i>Aid-el-Kebeer</i> (the Great Feast), when every family
kills and eats its own mutton.</p>

<p>The little shops in Tetuan group themselves together
more or less. There is another quarter where sieves are
made, a corner where baskets and the countrywomen's
huge straw hats are plaited, another where carpenters
congregate, and an open square where rugs, carpets, and
curios cram the shops, and so on.</p>

<p>We left the warm heat from the glowing cinders and
the cascade of sparks, and walked on into the <i>feddan</i>
(market-place), which was teeming with women from the
hills and villages round, come in to sell provisions.</p>

<p>The <i>Jews' Quarter</i> lies on one side of the feddan, shut
in by a gate at night and locked&mdash;a squalid, noisy, over-populated
spot, where the worst-kept donkeys and most
filth are to be met with. Tetuan is a clean city: on
every animal killed the "butchers" have to pay a tax;
the tax goes towards the sweeping of the streets
once a week, and towards their paving&mdash;that is, if the
basha is conscientious: the last basha ate and drank
the tax.</p>

<p>A gutter runs down the middle of the streets, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
chickens are killed, and the heads and uneatable parts
of flesh, fish, and fowl thrown. Mules and donkeys walk
along the gutter, while foot-people flatten themselves
against the walls. A well-laden mule fairly absorbs the
width of the little streets.</p>

<p>The condition of these wretched transport animals is
not due so much to wanton cruelty as to neglect, and
to a callousness bred of long familiarity. A Moor will
not trouble to prevent his beasts having sore backs and
fistulated withers and raw hindquarters, any more than
he sees that his children are warmly clad and suitably
fed. Fond of both, he is foolish and apathetic, treating
his mules roughly, cramming them with unnecessary
food or neglecting them, and invariably working them
till they drop.</p>

<p>One or two little caf&eacute;s we passed round the feddan,
and banished any connection between them and lunch
for ever and a day.</p>

<p>A little room in the shade hung with yellow matting,
no chairs, but a wide divan at the far end, where a few
Moors sat cross-legged or reclined, smoking long pipes
of soothing kif, and eating the pernicious haschisch&mdash;this
constitutes a caf&eacute;. A few of the Moors are playing cards;
the rest look on. A dome-shaped pewter teapot, filled
with a brew of steaming tea, stands on a low table, with
a painted glass beside it half full of mint, which a freckled
boy in a coarse jellab fills up from the teapot to the
brim and puts to his lips; then he lights a cheap cigarette.
A great urn, with an oil lamp under it, stands in one
corner.</p>

<p>No self-respecting Moor patronizes these caf&eacute;s: he is
the most fanatical of Mohammedans in a land reputed
to be more strictly religious than any Eastern country.
In public he observes his Prophet's laws, only indulging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
<i>sub rosa</i> in smoking&mdash;"eating the shameful," as it is
called.</p>

<p>Mohammed knew very well that Eastern peoples drink
to get drunk, and smoke and eat opium for the purpose
of intoxicating their senses. <i>Kif</i>, a herb something like
hemp, produces this effect on the brain. He therefore
forbade both.</p>

<p>When a Moorish "swell" wants to amuse himself, instead
of passing the time at a caf&eacute; he goes out for the day into
the country. There is generally an expression of perfect
satisfaction with life as he finds it, on his lineless biscuit-coloured
face and in his brown agate eyes&mdash;a content seldom
expressed under the top-hats in the Park. Time is to
him no "race": he drifts easily down the years; knows
no other home than, it may be, Tetuan; nor is conscious
that Tetuan sleeps, as it has slept for ages, curled up,
underneath the towering hills, white, petrified, like Lot's
wife.</p>

<p>Still down more streets, and on towards the Belgravia
of the city we walked, leaving steaming little hot-fritter
shops, where <i>sfins</i> are fried in oil and eaten with honey,
where cream tarts may possibly be made and honeyed
cakes, and crisp pastry prepared with attar of roses, and
candied musk lemons, and dates mixed with almond
paste. We left the fried-fish shops and fried spitted-meat
shops behind, whence emerge <i>kabobs</i>&mdash;second only
to <i>coos-coosoo</i>&mdash;and a smell indescribable; and we wound
down tortuous alleys, past quiet windowless houses, whose
great painted doors, yellow and brown, studded with
enormous nails and knockers, spoke respectability.</p>

<p>Never a straight street for six yards. Here an angle
with a door; turn down under an archway: there a
tiny branching alley, which we follow: here another door;
plunge down the opposite way. A woman passes us with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
a friend, walking as only women in Morocco walk&mdash;figures
in creamy haiks of the finest wool, which swathe them
entirely from top to toe like a sheet, a pair of eyes
barely showing between the folds. At the bottom of
the haiks a flash of colour obtrudes, tomato in one, beetle-green
in the other, and filmy muslin over both, which in
their turn allow a glimpse of ankles wrapped round in
snowy linen folds&mdash;rose-pink, gold-embroidered slippers
completing the whole, suggestive of a tea party.</p>

<p>A yard farther and we pass <i>El-Jama-el-Kebeer</i> (the
Big Mosque), which, unlike that at Tangier, stands with its
doors wide open, but in front of which no infidel may linger.
There was a vision of a cool tiled courtyard and splashing
fountains of white marble and clean yellow matting, of
endless tiled pillars vanishing into shade. There are
saint-houses in the city where women are allowed to
pray, but only upon one night in the whole year in
El-Jama-el-Kebeer&mdash;a field-day among the wives and concubines,
who flit like white moths through the darkness
in flocks to worship, carrying red-and-blue lanterns.</p>

<p>At last we reached the house of the Moor upon whom
Mr. Bewicke intended us to call&mdash;a specimen of the best
Moorish houses.</p>

<p>Alarbi Abresha has been nicknamed "the Duke of
Westminster"&mdash;the wealthiest man in Tetuan. A slave
responded to the hammer of the great knocker, demanded
who knocked, and then opened the door. Alarbi Abresha
was out; but his son, a youth badly marked with small-pox,
received us, dressed in a jellab of pale blue, tasselled,
and worked in white. Mr. Bewicke asked after <i>the house</i>.
No one in Morocco inquires after the wife or family
distinctively.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-09.png"><img src="./images/ill-09_th.png" alt="ALARBI ABRESHA'S HOUSE." title="ALARBI ABRESHA'S HOUSE." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Alarbi Abresha's House.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><i>Photo by A. Cavilla, Tangier.</i></p>

<p>A long passage led us into a large <i>patio</i> (courtyard), in
which orange-trees were growing. It was open to the sky,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
the floor tiled with shining tesselated tile-work; a marble
fountain rippled in the middle: the dado round the four
walls, the three rows of pillars which on all sides supported
the gallery above&mdash;all were tiled in the same mosaic of
small saffron-yellow, powder-blue, and white tiles, which
are baked, coloured, and glazed in primitive potteries outside
the city, and made only in Tetuan and Fez. A
Moorish house is the essence of purity and light, with its
whitewashed walls, its absence of all stifling furniture,
and its capability of being sluiced down from top to
bottom every day with rivers of water by barefooted
slaves.</p>

<p>"The Duke" had spared no dollars to make his house
beautiful. Of the triple row of arches, supported by the
pillars round the patio, the outside row was a plain horse-shoe,
the inner toothed, the inmost carved. Through an
avenue of pillars the rooms all round the patio look out
upon the fountain and the orange-trees. Slaves occupied
them. The kitchen also and the hummum are always on
the ground floor. We were taken up to the first floor by
the tiled staircase, with a plaster fan-shell ceiling, and were
shown into the best room&mdash;the room belonging to the
master of the house. The tiled floor was hidden by an
ugly modern French carpet in strips: white and coloured
mattresses were laid all round the walls upon the floor
instead of chairs. Two immense brass bedsteads stood in
recesses, blue silk four-posters; a great cushioned mattress
on the carpet beside the bed is reported to be used by the
wife; a slave will often sleep in the same room. The lower
half of the whitewashed walls was hung with ancient
silk brocaded hangings, a long-forgotten relic of the old
wandering life as nomad Arabs, and still used by Arabs for
the insides of their tents. The richer the owner, the better
his silk hangings: the design is invariably a succession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
of horse-shoe arches, more or less embroidered, and
giving the rooms a warm, luxurious air. In the mosques
very fine mats are used; in ordinary houses, caf&eacute;s, and
shops, yellow matting lines the walls. Above the old
hangings the Duke had hung a line of immense and
tawdry gilt-framed mirrors. There were clocks in the
room to the number of ten, some of them going; two
inlaid cabinets; three cases of artificial flowers under
glass; a great wooden coffer&mdash;the wife's property&mdash;holding
a wardrobe of clothes; a gun on one of the walls;
a rosary; a thermometer made in Germany: these were
the only knick-knacks. Moorish rooms combine bedroom
with sitting-room, but are devoid of washing-apparatus,
tables, chairs, books, or pictures. Bathing is done in the
hummum or in the courtyard of the mosque; of books
there are none; while pictures Mohammed forbade, as inclined
to lead to idolatry. Query: have many artists been
lost to the world in fourteen hundred years among a sect
numbering a hundred millions?</p>

<p>The ceiling and woodwork of the room were painted in
barbaric, gaudy hues, which mellow with age and "tone"
like a faded Kashmir shawl. A row of tiled pillars divided
the room lengthwise, and raised the inner half a step
above the outer: it was immensely lofty, lighted by the
great double doors only, which stood wide open on to the
patio. Glass is not used in Morocco: the windowless
rooms are aired by the unfastened doors which look on
to the patio, itself open to the winds of heaven. The
outside world can have little idea of the life going on
within the courtyard house: there is much seclusion
therein, in fitting harmony with the spirit of Morocco.</p>

<p>Fireplaces do not exist, though from December to
March the thermometer has sometimes, on single occasions,
touched freezing-point at night. Earthenware pans of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
charcoal, used for cooking, can be carried upstairs for
warmth.</p>

<p>The other rooms in Alarbi Abresha's house were all
more or less replicas of the best room shorn of its
gilt. As the laws of the Medes and Persians, so is the
arrangement of the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'matresses'">mattresses</ins> (<i>divans</i>) round the walls
inside a Moorish house.</p>

<p>A Moor does not spend his day indoors. He eats
and sleeps at home, but is otherwise sitting talking with
his friends in the city, or in his shop, or out at his
garden-house or fields.</p>

<p>He eats in any one of the divanned rooms in which he
happens to be at the time, his rule being to "sleep where
you will and eat where you will." A slave carries in his
dish of meat on a tray, and puts it on a table four inches
in front of the divan. Beef, mutton, and chicken are
cooked in oil till they fall apart and can be eaten with the
fingers. He eats vegetables and fruit, murmurs a "B`ism
Allah" beforehand and a "Hamdoollah" (God be praised)
at the end; washes his hands; drinks green tea, or begins
his meal with it and bread of fine white flour. His wife
has the refusal of the dish after her lord, never eating with
him; and the slaves follow her. As many as five dishes
may be brought up at a meal; and the master of the
house, sampling each, chooses which he will eat, and sends
the rest away. If he has a guest, it is the height of
politeness to select small pieces off the dish and put them
within the guest's reach, or, still better, into his mouth.</p>

<p>Moors, unless they are wealthy men, eat "by the
eye"&mdash;that is, not according to what they require, but
according to that they see set before them: frequent
hiccups express gratification at hospitality received, accompanied
by "Hamdoollah." The amount which a
Moor can eat is prodigious. There was a man at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
Fez who was reverenced as a saint by his neighbours,
because he had been known to eat a hundredweight of
<i>coos-coosoo</i> (porridge) and a whole sheep at a sitting.</p>

<p>Alarbi Abresha, Junior, meanwhile, took us on into
his father's guest-house, a suite of magnificent rooms,
decorated in execrable taste, the barbaric glories of the
old Moorish style giving place to modern French vulgarity.
A courtyard house can be a strange mixture. Its
woodwork, possibly <i>arrar</i>, a cypress of beautiful grain,
scented like cedar, cinnamon-coloured, and immensely
hard (out of which the Roman patricians cut their
precious tables, valued at their weight in gold if as much
as four feet wide: beams of arrar put into the C&oacute;rdovo
Mosque by the Moors a thousand years ago still exist);
its old silk hangings; its tiles, kept polished like jet, and
never desecrated by anything harder than a slippered
sole,&mdash;all alike are the finest relics of a taste which ruled
in the construction of the Alhambra, where Mauresque
design is seen at its best. The aristocrats of Tetuan
are descendants of the old Andalusian families, who, having
left Morocco and invaded Spain, settled there, built the
Alhambra, were in the course of time driven back over
the seas, and took refuge in Tetuan and other coast towns.
Their very title-deeds, together with the keys of their
houses in Granada, are still in the possession of their
descendants in Tetuan.</p>

<p>While the best work in the courtyard houses of
to-day harks back to the brave days of Spain, the
Moor of the twentieth century has less of the vitality
and originality which distinguished his forefathers, and
he is apt to mix cheap up-to-date decoration with the
patio and the windowless wall, of which the Duke's
guest-house may stand for an <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'exemple'">example</ins>.</p>

<p>When the great door had shut behind us, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
were outside in the street again, it seemed both narrow
and prosaic after the sunny patio, with the yellow-fringed
orange-trees almost branching into the rooms, and
the fitful accompaniment of running water, dear to the
Moorish ear.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon Mohammed, Ali, mules,
and baggage put in an appearance, and we found them
waiting in the feddan, anxious to put our tents up in
the middle of the noisy, crowded sok, where the wind,
which had dropped but little, was whirling dust round
in clouds, and where we should have been the centre
of a staring throng&mdash;at the same time, an ideal place
in the servants' eyes, suggesting caf&eacute;s and conversation
the whole night through. The camping-ground which
"the infidel" selects is an insoluble puzzle to the Moor,
and they went off mystified and disappointed, under orders
from the Consul to pitch the tents outside the city.</p>

<p>Later on we followed, by a street redolent and sweet
with honey, of which a great quantity had just come in
from the Riff country, leading to <i>B&aacute;b-el-Aukla</i> (the Gate of
Wisdom), so called because the elders of the city, the wise
men, used to sit outside on some of the great rocks: a fine
two-storied, square-shaped gateway, with a pointed arch
and toothed ornament above it. Three little windows
overlook the arch; the black noses of small cannon
protrude in a long row out of the white parapeted
walls; a flagstaff tops the whole, and flies the crimson
streamer of Morocco. A line of sea-green tiling beneath
the cannon breaks the flat wall, where the heads of
turbulent tribesmen hang occasionally, sent over from
some neighbouring raid by the Sultan's orders, and first
salted by the Jews in the city, <i>nolens volens</i>. The
cobbles were slippery under the gate. The huge, heavy
wooden doors, studded with iron bolts, are barred and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
locked every night half an hour after sunset. Inside,
looking back, just at the parting of two streets, a great
white wall faced us, topped with green tiles, grass-grown;
below, a horse-shoe arch, somewhat in relief, belted with
coloured tiles, defaced by age, contained a long solid
stone trough, into which two spouts of water gushed&mdash;never
dry in this city of springs. Mules and donkeys
and country-folk all stop and drink, and the front of
the trough is carved.</p>

<p>B&aacute;b-el-Aukla is the finest gate in the city.</p>

<p>Go where you will in Tetuan, at every turn water
bubbles into time-worn and artistically moulded troughs
and basins, under quaint arches, tiled in blue and brown
and white. In the narrow winding street-ways, between
the houses, half dark, still the bubbling of water is heard,
and the shining wet trough seen.</p>

<p>As we left the city and walked down the sandy road
which leads to the sea, our tents lay a quarter of a mile
off, two white spots, pitched on grass just off the road,
the mules picketed by them.</p>

<p>We had a somewhat light meal at six o'clock, Mohammed's
chicken turning out like hammered leather. He was no
cook.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-10.png"><img src="./images/ill-10_th.png" alt="OUR CAMP OUTSIDE TETUAN." title="OUR CAMP OUTSIDE TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Our Camp Outside Tetuan.</p>

<p>An Arabic proverb says, "What is past is gone, and
the future is distant; and to thee is the hour in which
thou art." It was obviously never intended by the Creator
that mankind should make plans. Morocco may have
its drawbacks, but it is at least one of those few and
blessed spots where it is waste of time to plan: life is
a matter of to-day, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>To-morrow?&mdash;Why, To-morrow I may be</p>
<p>Myself with Yesterday's Seven Thousand Years.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus some time that evening, when, after coping un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>successfully
with the chicken, it struck R. and myself
that Tetuan had attractions over and above the head
of Tangier, we settled then and there to stay on at
Tetuan as long as we liked the place, though the weather
looked very much like rain, not at all like camping out,
and we had no clothes with us to speak of.</p>

<p>Overcoming or ignoring these difficulties, we finally
decided to pay off our three men, send them back by
themselves to Tangier with the tents and camp outfit,
write to the Villa Valentina, pay our bill, have our boxes
packed up and sent over to us at Tetuan by muleteer,
and move ourselves into the Spanish <i>fonda</i> (inn) inside
the city. Thus were we left for the next six days with
one clean collar apiece.</p>

<p>In Tangier there had been some speculation on the
elasticity of the Spartan wardrobes which we had brought
out from England, at a moment when the dread of a vast
impedimenta happened to lie strong upon us. In Tetuan
such panics bury themselves. The slimmest wardrobe
will suffice. A country's own materials, whether home-spun
of Kashmir or sheep-skin coat of Afghanistan,
naturally meet its requirements best: deficiencies are
easily supplied, and later on we lived in mufti off the
backs of Tetuan sheep.</p>

<p>Lying in bed in the early morning before it was light,
duck were to be heard calling up the river; and, breakfast
over, we strolled down to the banks, where the thick
green orange-trees on the opposite side bore a crop of
cow-birds, sitting like a covey of white cockatoos on the
tips of the branches among the golden oranges, so thick
and snowy that the tree might well have burst into
abnormal flower.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock the camp was struck, and we had
burnt our ships: the last of the five mules, three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
men, and baggage tailed off out of sight along the road
to Tangier.</p>

<p>Under a cloudy sky, prophesying rain, we walked
into the city to look for quarters: better, perhaps, a
fonda in Tetuan than a tent at the fond&acirc;k in wet
weather.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This by God's grace is <i>El Moghreb</i>&mdash;Morocco&mdash;and here a wise
man is surprised at nothing that he sees and believes nothing that
he hears.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not easy to find a lodging in Morocco: there are
no <i>d&acirc;k bungalows</i>&mdash;no large white English residences,
with the familiar and hospitable <i>Burra Sahib</i>, a retinue
of servants, spare horses, and a spacious bedroom at
the disposal of the unexpected guest. Hotels, except at
Tangier, are impossible for any length of time, unless to
the vagaries of Spanish or Jewish cookery the heart can
harden itself.</p>

<p>We steeled our souls, assisted by the grateful sense
of freedom from all petty society functions, which in the
nature of things are unknown in a city where one vice-consul,
six women missionaries, and a post-office alone
represent the British flag&mdash;where there is no English
doctor, no English church.</p>

<p>Tetuan met all our needs: the only question was where
to live.</p>

<p>Immediately outside its walls lies a land of gardens and
orchards. Every Moor who can afford it has a garden,
wherein he cultivates grapes and fruit-trees,&mdash;a dim reflection
of that Paradise of his, which must be chequered
with acres of shade cast by great rocks and gigantic olive-trees;
which must be abundantly watered by running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
brooks of milk, honey, and wine; whose soil shall be flour,
white as snow. The Moor's Garden of Eden reserved for
the faithful after death bespeaks abundance and repose,
differing but little from a certain Heaven of Epicures,
wherein <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;s de fois gras</i> were eaten to the sound of
trumpets. Somewhere in his garden outside Tetuan he
builds himself a garden-house, to which in the summer he
migrates with his wife and slaves and the children of both,
his divans, carpets, and kitchen utensils: the town house
is locked up and stands empty while he spends four or
five months under his vines and figs.</p>

<p>At the time we arrived in Tetuan&mdash;early December&mdash;not
a garden-house but still lay empty; and naturally in
their direction our longing eyes turned&mdash;an impossible
desire, it was said, thereby clinching the resolve to make
a superhuman effort to bring it to pass: between living in
the city and a garden there could be no choice. In the
meantime a Spanish fonda must constitute a make-shift
until that came which is laid down for those who wait.</p>

<p>Inside Tetuan two hotels presented themselves. With
fonda number one we could not come to terms; it was
not attractive-looking: we took a high-handed line and
left. Fonda number two, after much haggling in Spanish,
agreed to take us both at the modest sum of seven-and-sixpence
a day, all included. No sooner was the bargain
struck than a messenger arrived post-haste from fonda
number one, to say that they would take us at our own
terms. Their golden opportunity was lost. Report said
fonda number one might be a trifle cleaner, but fonda
number two had the better cook: the inside man carried
the day in favour of number two.</p>

<p class="sc">A Veiled Figure Outside the Gate.</p>

<p>It was one among many flat-roofed whitewashed houses
in the Moorish Quarter, in a street barely six feet wide.
There was no outlook except from the roof-top, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
the washing dried: there were no windows, the rooms
depending for light upon double doors opening on to
the tiny tiled patio&mdash;except in our own case, where the
second room allotted to us was built over the top of
the street, and had two windows cut in the walls by
the Spanish occupants, neither of which quite shut, and
provided us with an ample supply of air. The room
beyond possessed dilapidated doors, which gave upon the
patio. The patio was, of course, open to all the rain of
heaven as well as to all the sun: it was the principal
sitting-room of the family, where, downstairs, on fine days,
they plucked chickens, made bread, washed, sat and received
callers, did needlework and chattered; on wet days
creeping disconsolately round the lake of water in the
middle of the tiled floor, where the rain dropped&mdash;splash&mdash;taking
refuge on one sheltered seat in company with
three dogs, a cat, and a tame chicken, or retiring into the
dark little rooms which surrounded the lake.</p>

<p>The family comprised Spanish parents, married daughter
and husband, three unmarried sisters, a brother, and a
lodger&mdash;an old Spanish music-master. The fonda was run
by the married daughter, a lady with a temper, who made
everybody else work: her mother and one sister cooked;
the second sister was busy with a trousseau and a young
man; the third and prettiest&mdash;Amanda&mdash;waited on us.
On the whole we were not uncomfortable, in spite of the
Spanish element. Our rooms were clean: one afternoon
we found a chicken sunning itself in a patch of sunlight
on the floor of one&mdash;nothing worse. Dinner was sometimes,
and Amanda was always, lacking in certain points
to a critical eye. Sometimes it was a skirt, sometimes a
petticoat, she wore: except on high days, it was doubtful
and dependent upon chance threads and pins. All
Amanda's blouses were low-necked, whatever the time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
day: the stains and slits and remnants of torn frills were
unique. She wore her sleeves turned up, and silver bangles
on her arms. Amanda never buttoned her boots, and
often put in an appearance with bare feet.</p>

<p>But Amanda was redeemed by her head-dress and her
manners. She wound a crimson shawl gracefully over
her dark head, after the fashion of a mantilla, with an
effect beyond reproach. Amanda had a gracious way of
putting things: she bore herself with infinite dignity, and
a <i>je-ne-sais-quoi</i> which pointed to a mixed ancestry; she
had well-shaped hands.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the evening her knock preceded
preparations for dinner, while she munched something or
hummed a tune meanwhile. Seas of thin soup invariably
preceded a dish of shapeless masses of "soup-meat,"
garnished with boiled peas. The third course consisted
of chicken or partridge: on less happy occasions foreign
and "shudderous" dishes appeared; a peculiar jelly shell-fish
was the lowest ebb&mdash;that and pork we resented.
Last of all, a tall glass fruit-dish would arrive, the standard
sweet&mdash;<i>flan</i> (caramel pudding). Then a long pause.
Finally, Amanda's step, with a great plate of hot toast
and a tall tin coffee-pot: black coffee was the best part
of the meal.</p>

<p>A day or two after settling into the fonda we were
asked to our first entertainment in a Moorish house.
Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli wanted Mr. Bewicke and ourselves
to "tea" with him.</p>

<p>As in the case of "the Duke's" house, so here, all the
womenkind were hidden away on account of the Consul.
Mohammedans are jealous and suspicious of their wives
and daughters to a degree, and strongly resent, if not
prevent, an Englishman's going up on to the flat roof,
lest he have a view of fair occupants beyond or below.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
Nevertheless, the wives always contrive to peep out of
some loophole and see all there is to be seen.</p>

<p>Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli received us all three alone, as a
matter of course, and led us upstairs to his best room.
Like many others among the better class of Moors, our
host had a shop and himself sold groceries. At the
same time his sister is the wife of one of the Ministers;
and as there is no respect of persons in Morocco, Hadj
Mukhtar Hilalli might be called upon himself any day
to fill a high official position, and be obliged to go, raising
money, if he had not wherewithal to support the post,
which, if a lucrative one, would soon repay the outlay.</p>

<p>Trade at Tetuan, and apparently everywhere else over
Morocco, is not what it once was: the old flintlocks,
inlaid with silver wire and lumps of pink coral, are
unknown since the last gun-maker died; snuff-nuts, even
slippers, do but a small business. Living is more
expensive than it was: it cost Hadj Mukhtar three
shillings a day to feed himself and the whole household,
he said.</p>

<p>The room into which we went&mdash;our host leaving his
yellow slippers in the doorway, and motioning us all
to sit down on the divans round the walls&mdash;was hung
with a silk dado, tiled in mosaic, and overlooked a good-sized
patio with a running fountain.</p>

<p>Our dirty boots compared unfavourably with the Hadj's
clean, bare feet, which, as he sat down cross-legged on
the white and embroidered cushions, were hidden underneath
his voluminous garments; whereas ours, not to
the manner born, contracted cramp, unless stuck out in
an ungainly way.</p>

<p>A gorgeously upholstered bed filled up one corner of the
room; a gun hung on the wall. There was nothing else.</p>

<p>Three little sons of the house and Mr. Bewicke's soldier-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>servant
having followed us in and seated themselves,
preparations for tea&mdash;already waiting, arranged in front
of the divans on four brass trays, standing on four low
tables a few inches high&mdash;began.</p>

<p>Hadj Mukhtar <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Hillali'">Hilalli</ins>, sitting on his heels in front
of his tea-table, making tea with his thin brown hands,
and presiding over it all with true Oriental dignity, was
a veritable Moses or Aaron reincarnated. Women and
men alike mature rapidly in this country, putting on
flesh and becoming matronly and aldermanic without at
the same time growing lined or aged: a wealthy man of
twenty-five is portly and slow of movement&mdash;the result
of Eastern habits coupled with the climate.</p>

<p>Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli, barely forty years old by his
own account, had a white beard and moustache, no
wrinkles, eyes of mild blue and benign expression, equally
guileless and unfathomable.</p>

<p>Talking in Arabic to Mr. Bewicke, he drew the tray
close to the low divan in front of him, saw that his sons
provided cushions for our backs, and proceeded to wash
the green tea in a bright nickel pear-shaped teapot,
with water from the great brass urn which stood over
a charcoal-burner: the washed tea was then transferred
into a twin teapot, which the Hadj generously filled with
immense lumps of sugar out of a glass dish standing
on a tray by itself, stacked high with great blocks split
off the cone with a hatchet. Heavy with lump sugar,
a handful of mint and bay leaves was also crammed into
the little remaining space in the teapot, the boiling water
out of the urn was turned on over all, filling up every
chink, the lid shut down upon the steaming fragrant
brew, and the teapot set back upon the brass tray,
the centre of a ring of tiny gilt and painted glasses.</p>

<p>The eldest son&mdash;a boy of fourteen, dressed in red,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
and wearing a leather belt embroidered with blue, and
a fez-bag fastened thereto to match, whose head had
evidently had its weekly shave that afternoon&mdash;lit a lamp
underneath a little incense-burner, filling it with sticks
of sweet-scented wood, till an odoriferous blue smoke rose
from it. With much care he carried the burner to us,
and put it inside our coats, thoroughly impregnating
every thickness with warmth and odours of cedar-wood.
It was taken last of all to Mr. Bewicke's soldier, who
manipulated it correctly as a Moor, putting it inside his
flowing apparel, and sitting down with every fold closed
in round him like a miniature tent, the burner smoking
away inside. A scent-spray was then handed, with
which we anointed ourselves in Moorish fashion, inside
our hats, up our sleeves, and round our necks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli poured out tea with a
great elevation of the teapot, raising his arm and showing
greens and blues mixed to perfection underneath his <i>k`sa</i>&mdash;a
white woollen or silk robe worn only by gentlemen&mdash;which,
semi-transparent and gauze-like, fell in white waves
over his shoulders on to the divan. Under the k`sa was
a long garment with wide sleeves and buttoned all down
the front&mdash;a <i>kaftan</i>&mdash;of sea-green cloth, embroidered with
gold. The kaftan just revealed a waistcoat of a shade
of blue, with gold and green buttons and embroidery.
Underneath this, and above his white cotton shirt and
drawers, he probably wore a woollen jacket. But greens
and blues and gold were alone visible. Sometimes several
kaftans or several jellabs are worn one on top of the other,
all colours mixed, particularly if the owner is travelling.
Moors are a wool-clad people for the most part, due to
the wet winter climate: the men's brown woollen hooded
jellabs keep out the rain more or less, and the women's
white woollen haiks answer the same purpose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
The Hadj turned up his sleeves as he made tea, the
underside of them being embroidered for this purpose.
It was ready by this time, and brought us on a brass
tray by the eldest son. Though the little glasses are not
capable of holding much, the violent sweetness and the
flavour of mint prevent the uninitiated from doing justice
to the regulation three cups which courtesy demands
should be drunk. But it grows, even upon the European,
that steaming golden-brown beverage, fresh and fragrant
with sweet thymes, while something in the climate of
Morocco tends to make sugar acceptable after a few weeks.
We supplied ourselves with sponge cake, pounds of which
were piled on a brass tray in front of us: sweet biscuits,
toasted nuts, almonds, and raisins abounded on the same
lavish scale; while a wicker basket, like a large waste-paper
basket, was full of thirty or forty round cakes of bread,
several sizes larger than a Bath bun, made of the finest
semolina flour, flavoured with aniseed and baked a warm
biscuit colour.</p>

<p>The Hadj pressed third cups upon us, but with the
innate breeding of every Moor understood the limited
capacity born of early days in Morocco. A Moor is
nothing if not courteous, and, whatever his real feelings,
conceals them under polite speeches. He will, as somebody
has said, "cut your throat <i>most politely, most politely</i>,"
or with profound urbanity offer you a cup of poison.</p>

<p>Our host had sipped a first cup before allowing the tea
to be handed round&mdash;a custom observed to assure the guest
that the teapot was free from poison, and that no deadly
drink was offered us, containing seeds which should
propagate a horrible disease in the intestines, destroying
life sooner or later. Poisoning is only too common among
the Moors themselves, cases occurring almost every day in
the country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
Once, when Sir John Hay was having an angry discussion
with a governor&mdash;Mokhta&mdash;coffee was brought in.
Mokhta, as usual, took the cup intended for the Englishman,
and put it to his lips, making a noise as though sipping it,
but which sounded suspiciously like blowing into it, and
then offering it to Sir John. Not fancying the bubbled
coffee, he declined, saying to Mokhta, "I could not drink
before you. Pray keep that cup yourself," and helping
himself at the same time to the second cup, which he
drank. Mokhta put down the cup which he had offered
Sir John, and did not drink it.</p>

<p>Some one in Tetuan dies every year of poisoning. Wives
frequently kill their husbands. No two brothers, both in
ministerial offices at Court, would dream of sitting down
and eating together without precautions beforehand, on
account of <i>the marked pieces</i> in the dish. One brother, as
he dines, may invite the other, who happens to enter, to
join him in the meal; but he will reply, "I have already
dined." <i>He dare not.</i></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli talked away in Arabic
to Mr. Bewicke, who translated for us. He said that
Menebbi, the Minister of War who went over to England
with the last embassy, and who is practically Prime
Minister, lost a considerable amount of influence during
the short two months he was away, but that he was
rapidly gaining ground, and might be said to be completely
restored to favour again. Menebbi is the only one of
the Sultan's Ministers who is likely to help him to reform
the Government of Morocco. A clever, crafty brain, the
whole Court under his thumb, it yet needed but an absence
of eight weeks to generate in that hotbed of Eastern
intrigue such a tissue of false evidence and lies as nearly
cost Menebbi his position, if not his life. His enemies
possessed the Sultan's ear; every Menebbi had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
removed from the army; he had probably not a single
friend left in Morocco. With the fickleness of their race,
his name was cursed at every street corner; and when
spoken of, the people said, "There <i>is</i> no Menebbi." Hurrying
back from England, the tidings of his fall reached
Menebbi when he landed at Mazagan: he was to be
arrested. But the man they had to deal with was one
of those few who make a full use of every opportunity
life ever offers. From Mazagan to Morocco City, where
the Court was, a distance of a hundred and forty miles,
he had a relay of mules and horses posted, and he rode
without stopping. There were dead and sorry beasts
left on the road that day. Menebbi rode up to the
cannon's mouth, so to speak: he need never have gone
to Morocco City, but that would have meant his sinking
into private life and his banishment from Court; he
preferred to "play to the uttermost," and he staked life
and fortune on the card he held. Things in Morocco
City hung on an eyelash: the great man galloped in
from Mazagan, went straight to the palace, never paused
a moment, straight to the Sultan's private door, straight
into the presence itself. And who shall say what
Menebbi said to the Sultan through that night which
he passed with him&mdash;what false accusations he refuted,
what diplomacy he used? Next day Menebbi was
not at prayers; he was "sick": in other words, he
had tidings of a plot to kill him on his way to the
mosque. However, in time he righted himself: now
his enemies are under his heel, and Menebbi breathes
again.</p>

<p>The Hadj spoke of the great wish the Sultan has to visit
England&mdash;an impossibility, for in the eyes of his fanatical
subjects he would be countenancing the unbelievers, and
his throne would be handed over to a successor: the throne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
to which he succeeded, for the first time in the history
of Morocco, without having to fight his way to it&mdash;a fact
owed to the Wazeer's sagacity. Keeping the death of the
old Sultan secret for a few days, the Wazeer meantime
bribed and forced the Ministers to accept the young
heir as Sultan, hurried to Fez, summoned every citizen
to the mosque, had the doors locked, proclaimed the
news of the Sultan's death, and surprised or forced
the whole mosqueful into swearing allegiance to the
present ruler.</p>

<p>So far the Sultan knows only two or three places
in his whole kingdom, and has practically spent his
life at one&mdash;Morocco City, or <i>Marrakesh</i>, as the Moors
call it. Nor would his journeys be reckoned blessings
by the unfortunate country through which he passed.
Only able to move with an army, that army, without
any commissariat or transport, feeding itself upon its
march, wipes corn and food off the face of the land
as a sponge wipes a slate. "Where the Sultan's horse
treads the corn ceases to grow." He seldom travels
with less than thirty thousand followers; and, supposing
he is passing through a turbulent tribe, fights his way
as he goes, leaving ruin and desolation behind. "They
make a desert, and they call it peace."</p>

<p>Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli had travelled considerably farther
afield than his sovereign; he knew Genoa, Marseilles,
Egypt, and of course Mecca. The Mussulman pilgrims
passing through Constantinople on their way to Mecca
this year are, he told us, very numerous, the Sultan
having ordered the fares on the Massousieh Company's
steamers to be reduced one-half for them. He thought
that about two thousand Moors would be leaving Tangier
in the early spring for the pilgrimage, returning some
three months later. Neither the Hadj's sons nor Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
Bewicke's soldier joined in the conversation, but continued
steadily to consume tea, all eyes and ears.</p>

<p>At last the trays were removed; and there being no
co-religious eye to shock, Hadj Mukhtar indulged in a
cigarette, while we puzzled him with a few tricks of
balance and reach, which pleased him quite as much
as his boys: everybody tried their hands, and finally
the Hadj sent his eldest son for an old, heavy sword,
and, squatting on the floor, showed us a clever piece
of leverage with it and his thumb, which it was in vain
to try and imitate.</p>

<p>Watching our failures, he produced a snuff-box, a
small cocoanut-shell, ornamented with little silver and
coral knobs, with a narrow ivory mouthpiece, a stopper,
and an ivory pin fastened to the cocoanut-shell to stir
up the snuff inside&mdash;Tetuan snuff&mdash;noted for its pungent
flavour. Hadj Mukhtar jerked the grains through the
narrow mouthpiece into the hollow of the back of his
thumb, where all Moors lay it, then lifted his hand up to
his nose.</p>

<p>Near the door hung his rosary of ninety-nine beads,
reminding the pious Mussulman of the ninety-nine
attributes of God. Each of the ninety-nine beads
corresponds to the name of some holy man, and as
the bead is passed along with the hand the saint's name
is murmured. Curious that the use of rosaries in the
Spanish Church is said to have been borrowed first of
all from the Spanish Moors.</p>

<p>The eldest son of our host was, his father told us,
looking forward to beginning the Fast of R&aacute;madhan
this year&mdash;fasting, as he was only a novice, for half the
day instead of the whole of it: evidently as much
importance and excitement were attached to the prospect
as later on would attend the boy's marriage. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
same boy of fourteen is learning to write in Latin
characters, for a Moor a most unusual and advanced
step: at present he was only wearing a little red fez
cap, not having reached the age of turbans, with all
their dignified symmetry. The Kor&#257;n was all the
literature the boy would ever know. Strange that a
strong and sober people should have for ages confined
their studies to the Kor&#257;n, an occasional Arab poet,
and a sacred treatise or two. There is, as I have
already said, no literature, no art, no science, in Morocco,
and no architecture&mdash;the Kor&#257;n forbidding, it is said,
research or study in any line except that of religion.
Geography is entirely unknown. Like Moors in general,
Hadj Mukhtar may have heard of London and Paris,
and might know the names Germany and Russia, besides
Mecca; but none of the former would have any connection
or "place" in his mind, and Morocco must be,
he is confident, the finest country under the sun. If it
were brought home to him that his country is in a
decadent condition, he would reply that at least it
is good enough for him as it is; and that if Europeans
were allowed to exploit it and to settle therein, the
end would be prosperity for the Western civilization,
and a knuckling-under on the part of the Moorish&mdash;which
is true.</p>

<p>We talked on upon one and another subject till it grew
late, but before we left our host took R. and myself
to see his wife, downstairs, in a smaller room. Five
wives are allowed by Mohammed, but few Moors in
Tetuan were rich enough to afford as many, and contented
themselves with slaves. We were not impressed
by the very plain, sallow-faced lady, with a black fringe
and hard brown eyes, who shook hands with us, and from
her likeness to the eldest boy was probably his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
The second son was evidently by a slave: there was no
mistaking that likeness&mdash;a fat, happy individual, the greatest
contrast to another slave, who, though well dressed, was
pale and miserable-looking. Two or three other corpulent,
smiling blackamoors made up the sum-total of the party
in the downstairs room&mdash;most comfortable, lounging on
the cushions, they looked, no mean advertisements of
Hadj Mukhtar's "table." The principal and favourite wife
possessed a noisy sewing-machine, which she proudly
displayed.</p>

<p>Every Moor's establishment has its slaves&mdash;so many,
according to his income: in Tetuan they are sold privately,
and frequently exchanged one for the other, while the
wives are as easily divorced. Every year something like
three thousand slaves come into Morocco, chiefly from
the Soudan: a few are stolen from Moorish tribes; the
rest are brought in by Moorish traders, who catch them
in various ways, such as scattering sweetmeats, or in hard
times corn, round the villages, up to neighbouring coverts,
just as a poacher at home entices pheasants with raisins,
then pouncing out and carrying them off.</p>

<p>As there are no such things as Moorish women-servants,
negresses and slaves of various types step into
the gap, and the evil of this influx of black blood is seen
in the deterioration of a fine race, and the increase of
the type which tends towards thick lips, low foreheads,
and sensual tastes. The slavery of Christians in Morocco,
once common, has been by treaty abolished since the
day when the savage Sultan Mulai Ismael had eleven
thousand Christian slaves in Mequinez employed in
building his walls, whose bodies, when they succumbed,
were mixed in with the stones and mud of the buildings.
Slaves are not ill treated in the present day, though now
and again one may be flogged to death as the result of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
fault or the malice and slander of a jealous fellow-slave:
as a rule they live happily; and if a female slave bears a
male child to her master, by a law in the Kor&#257;n both
mother and son are <i>ipso facto</i> freed, though they continue
to live on in the same house.</p>

<p>The last thing Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli showed us was his
hummum, cunningly arranged to flank the kitchen fire at
the back. A tiny room; but four of his wives and slaves
could, he explained, take their bath in it at once. There
was a small stone slab inside as a seat, and hot air
came in by means of a pipe in one corner. The <i>hummum</i>,
or Turkish bath, is partly enjoined by the Kor&#257;n and
partly taken for its own enjoyment; it is a feature of
every Moorish house of any pretension, and largely used
by men and women.</p>

<p>The evening was a dark one, and we picked our way
back to the fonda by the light of lanterns: it is impossible
to go out at night in Tetuan without carrying
one; the streets are wholly unlit, and the refuse-heaps
and central gutters unpleasant traps.</p>

<p>Next morning R. and I strolled out of the city in
the direction of Ceuta by way of the <i>B&aacute;b-el-M`kabar</i>
(the Gate of the Tombs). Just beyond this gateway congregates
in the road <i>el doollah</i> (the drove)&mdash;that is to say,
the mules and donkeys belonging to any one in Tetuan
who has no work for them on that particular day. They
are all left by their owners at this spot in the care of
a tall, tattered Moor, whose business in life is to look
after them; and there they lie in the sandy road or lean
up against the hot wall or each other, one of the saddest
sights on God's earth, some of them infant two-year-olds,
all of them overworked and starved. About midday
the drover drives his charges off to the nearest grass&mdash;such
as it is&mdash;and the ragged squad troops along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
stony track without bridles and without spirit to abuse
its freedom. They have none of them packs or saddles,
unless their sore backs are too deeply aggravated to allow
of exposure to the flies and dust; and in due time, one
by one, the old or the dying drop tacitly out of the
ranks; a couple of days&mdash;the scavenging dogs' work is
done&mdash;and only a tangled knot of bones is kicked away
from the roadside by the feet of the living generation,
which have picked up the scantiest feed, and are straying
back citywards again in the late afternoon, to be called
for outside the B&aacute;b-el-M`kabar each by its owner.</p>

<p>El doollah had not started; and leaving them all in
the road below us, we passed the little knots of countrywomen
who sit by the B&aacute;b-el-M`kabar selling myrtle for
laying upon the graves, and wound our way uphill through
the old Mussulman cemetery, with its quaint domed
tombs and toothed, arched doorways, cracked, decayed,
and yellow with lichen, half hidden among the tangle of
bushes and wild flowers on the rough slope.</p>

<p>The older of the tombs are probably those of the first
Moors who fled from Spain in the days of that great
<i>trek</i> back to Morocco: a much later and very conspicuous
dome belongs to a brave lady, who, not a hundred years
ago, did her best to defend Tetuan against the Spaniards,
fighting side by side with the Moorish troops, and, in
the course of the siege, accounting for half a dozen
Spaniards, thereby earning for herself in due course a
Joan of Arc reputation and a public sepulchre.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-12.png"><img src="./images/ill-12_th.png" alt="A MOHAMMEDAN CEMETERY." title="A MOHAMMEDAN CEMETERY." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">A Mohammedan Cemetery.</p>

<p>The cemetery was overgrown with <i>ayerna</i> root, one of
the commonest weeds in Morocco, poisonous when it is
eaten raw, though it is possible, after boiling the root for
ten or twelve hours, spreading it out to dry in the sun,
and grinding it in a mill, to make a sort of bitter bread
out of the flour, and to subsist upon that. This the poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
do to a great extent, whenever corn runs short and they
have nothing but roots and grasses to fall back upon:
their pale yellow faces and emaciated bodies tell a tale
of the ayerna root. We grubbed some up with a little
difficulty in the stiff clay soil with nothing but sticks
to help. Fifteen inches down we found the root, a small
whitish bulb, the size of a bluebell root.</p>

<p>There is much desolation about the old cemetery, with
its crumbling ruins; but the sun struck a key-note of
splendour, and turned the lichened stones into nuggets
of gold.</p>

<p>A black raven sat on a grey rock above us and croaked;
below lay the white city&mdash;white beyond all English ideas
of whiteness. Two tall minarets, with simple straight
lines, only a mosaic of green tiling let into their flat faces,
cut the peaks of the mountains beyond. At a quarter
past twelve a little white flag slowly mounted to the top
of each mosque; an infinitesimally small black figure
appeared against the sky; then leaning over the parapet
and looking down upon the humming city, a cry broke
from the figure, and was carried over to us upon the wind&mdash;a
cry which rose and fell, most musical, most sonorous:
"Allah Ho Akbar&mdash;Allah Ho Akbar." The black dot
moved round the parapet, and east and west and north
and south chanted the great summons to the Faithful
to prayer. And then the little white flag was hauled
down.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river the neutral-coloured
villages could be picked out by their white saint-houses.
Morocco is stuck as full of saints' tombs&mdash;fuller&mdash;than
England of dissenting chapels. They stud the land.
Moors rid themselves of much valuable energy in the
erection, by countless thousands, of tombs to the memory
of the eccentric or pious dead; and distances are measured,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
tracks marked, not from church to church as in Spain,
nor from village to village as in England, but from saint-house
to saint-house, each of which is village-green, club,
or public-house rolled into one, where the men gossip,
the pious read, travellers halt, offerings are brought the
dead saint, and sick children arrive to be healed&mdash;all
at a little whitewashed building with a dome like an oven
outside, and a horse-shoe arch, an olive- or a fig- or a palm-tree,
a flag-staff hung with morsels of rag, and often a
spring of water. At four cross-tracks, instead of sign-posts,
heaps of stones, cairns, are to be found, placed
in such a way as to indicate the direction in which the
next saint's tomb lies.</p>

<p>A saint-house or two spot the green plain below the
cemetery, which merges into the seven miles of flats
stretching from the city to the sea, the haunt of wild
duck, plover, and snipe, among wastes of coarse grass,
marsh, and red tangle. Coils of grey river lie upon the
flats: the very flatness over which the stream snakes is
at once most strong&mdash;serene.</p>

<p>As we walked down the hillside, a brown figure upon
a flat-topped tomb was silhouetted against the plain: he
raised himself, and then again prostrated his body to
the earth, his face set to the distant belt of blue sea,
worshipping towards Mecca.</p>

<p>That afternoon we visited Semsar, a village two or
three hours' ride from Tetuan, up in the mountains to
the west. R. had a sedate brown mule with no idea of
exerting himself: my mount was a clever little grey,
nervous and rather handy with his heels, nearly kicking
me more than once when I dismounted or mounted carelessly.
We rode, as usual, on the high-peaked Moorish
saddles, covered with scarlet cloth, such as every Moor
uses&mdash;the stirrup-leathers of twisted scarlet silk, several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
thick saddle-cloths underneath, the girths never drawn,
the saddle only kept from slipping over head or tail by
scarlet britching and breastplate. It is impossible to
mount unless the stirrup is held. After repeating the sacramental
word "B`ism Allah" (a Moor mounts and dismounts
in the name of God), with a man at his stirrups, he sinks
without an effort into his saddle, amidst a furbelow of
white robes, which he has afterwards arranged carefully
for him. Possibly for this reason he gets on and off
as seldom as possible, hugging the convenient maxim,
common among the Moors, that mounting and dismounting
fatigue an animal more than carrying a burden. He
rides with his knees up to his chin: he is a natural horseman,
and looks at home in his practically girthless and
quite shapeless saddle, which must have given him a
pang, if ever he galloped for his life in front of his enemies,
and reflected that his safety was dependent upon the
breastplate. A man, before now, has, as he rode, unwound
his waistcloth, and twisted it round his horse's neck, for
further security against the saddle's slipping back.</p>

<p>Mr. Bewicke and his soldier rode with us: the latter
a dark, lean-faced, unwholesome-looking man, unable,
like so many of his countrymen, to grow any hair on
his face&mdash;an obsequious individual too, inspiring little
trust; below his long blue cloak he wore brown riding-boots,
embroidered with orange, and fastening up the
back with orange-thread buttons.</p>

<p>My little grey bustled along; but once or twice, when
the road fell away into a steep drop, his weak hind legs
gave under him, and he "sat down": we soon learnt
the effect which merely shaking the feet in the great
angular stirrups has on mules whose sides have often
been in touch with the sharp points, and jogged forward
wherever the bad road allowed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
We had left the city by another of its six gates&mdash;the
<i>B&aacute;b-el-Toot</i> (Mulberry Gate), the old name pointing back
to an energetic past, when mulberries, silk-worms, and
silk-weaving flourished around Tetuan&mdash;when the cultivation
of sugar-cane, cotton, and rice in Morocco was
more than a memory.</p>

<p>Following for a time the road to Tangier, we branched
off to the right, and took a rough path winding upwards,
passing a spring where women wash clothes, three parts
walled in, to prevent their being seen.</p>

<p>A little higher up and one of the countless saints'
tombs came in sight&mdash;better known in this case as
the Robbers' Tower, where brigands congregate at sunset,
and from an excellent coign of vantage keep a look-out
on the Tangier road, to drop on any unfortunate
so foolhardy as to be on it late in the day. After
dark no Moor from Tetuan would walk near this saint-house.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks after this very ride a man was
murdered on the Tangier road, why or wherefore no
one knew, except that his body was found, brought
into Tetuan, and buried without further investigation,
since his relatives were neither rich nor powerful enough
to institute a search and demand compensation.</p>

<p>Robbery in Morocco is almost sanctioned by Providence;
it is made so simple. The lonely tracks, the absence
of police, the inconveniences of travelling, and the innumerable
wells scattered over the country, almost sunk
for the reception of inconvenient bodies&mdash;one and all
tempt a man to turn brigand; and yet Europeans are
seldom attacked, in view of the fine imposed upon the
tribe in whose territory a crime is committed.</p>

<p>Thus the borders, where several tribes meet, are always
unsafe country, one tribe disposing of bodies which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
have done to death by depositing them in the territory of
the next tribe. But even in "Christian-ridden" Tangier
a German was knifed three years ago walking home,
as was his custom, at dusk. He happened to have no
money on him. His murderer was given up to justice&mdash;that
is, the basha of Tangier said some one must die,
and together with the fine the tribe outside Tangier
produced a man, who was duly executed, though whether
he was the murderer . . . . . .</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we were leaving the millet-fields behind
us&mdash;stubbles, an occasional stalk three feet high, no
lying for birds&mdash;and were in a country of wild lavender
and stunted bushes: these consisted chiefly of cistus or else
palmetto, a little dwarf palm, the fruit of which is eaten
by goats, and the root by natives as a vegetable, while
its fibrous leaves make rope and baskets and a hundred
things. A bleak undulating country, which ran up into
rocky blue gorges and grey peaks on the right hand.
The path was almost blocked at one point by an
immense cairn on the top of a ridge&mdash;a holy pile, upon
which the devout Moor in passing casts a stone, because
from this spot the mountain can be made out on which
the venerated shrine of Mulai Abdesalam lies, in Beni
Anos, the goal of thousands of pilgrims each year.
Though it is within a day's ride of Tangier, the country
for miles around is forbidden to any European, and two
Englishmen only have penetrated into the sacred city of
Shesh&aacute;wan, which lies in the same district. Mr. Walter
B. Harris and Mr. Somers, at different times, got inside,
but only at sunset, and after lying in hiding all night
had to flee for their lives at dawn.</p>

<p>Gradually we reached wilder and more rocky country,
recalling Scotland as far as the open moorland went. If
fir-trees were planted on the sheltered slopes, the fir-pins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
should, in conjunction with the natural soil, form land
capable of growing vines&mdash;an idle dream in the Morocco
of to-day.</p>

<p>Between two hills in front of us towered a cliff of rocky
red limestone, which might once have formed the bed
of some vast stream. Semsar lay where the waters should
have struck the rock beneath as they fell: a more sheltered
village could not be, facing south-east. The cliff above
is still riddled with the remains of an old silver-mine,
worked years ago by the Portuguese: the ladders and
scaffolding inside have fallen to pieces, and after penetrating
along dark tunnels on hands and knees for a certain distance
an open shaft intervenes, and further exploration
is impossible.</p>

<p>Semsar, nestled into its crevice, takes more or less the
local brown; but among the thatched huts, rising one above
the other like an uneven pile of mud terraces, a few walls
were whitewashed, and of course a white village mosque
stood guard over all on the top of a hillock. There is
something a trifle "animal" in these villages, rough
clusters of bee's-comb or ant-heaps or beavers' lodgings
as they might be, assuming exactly the shade of their
surroundings, as nests the colour of their hiding-places,
or as the kh&#257;ki-coloured sand-lizard, desert-lark, and
sand-grouse of the great Sahara take on the yellow-ochre
tone of that desert.</p>

<p>A friend belonging to Mr. Bewicke's soldier had ridden
out behind us. He owned a garden at hand, and asked
if we would go in and look at it. We stooped low under
a white stone doorway, an imposing structure, invariably
the entrance to every garden: the door generally painted
Reckitt's blue, and kept locked with a key eight inches
long, while on each side of the gateway the cane fence is
tumbling to pieces and offering useful gaps to marauders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>&mdash;a
curious inversion of the rule in Spain, where to this
day they bar the window heavily and leave the door open.</p>

<p>Though to all appearance the owner was a hard-working
Moor, the garden at any rate bore no great signs of
expenditure of labour. We found ourselves in an overgrown
wilderness of orange-trees, peaches, pears, figs,
plums, damsons, cherries, white mulberries, quinces, jasmine,
all overgrown and stabbed by the interloping prickly
pear&mdash;a good fruit, too, in its way, and a "useful beast"
as a hedge.</p>

<p>Half of his oranges were always stolen, the owner said;
the remaining half brought him in from sixty to ninety
shillings a year, selling perhaps at a shilling or two the
thousand. He had evidently not the capital to get the
half of what such fruitful soil could give with Gibraltar
at hand for export, nor the means of securing to himself
any money he made; and it is poor work putting
money into the hands of the nearest extortionate sheikh.
Yet his garden was, and is to every Moor, a source of
great satisfaction and content: truly a field of the
slothful, a garden where the mystic finds rest and heart's
ease, and the two things which appeal most to sun-baked
men&mdash;shade and water. It is enough in such a
spot to drowse away the sunny hours amidst the hum
of bees, the rattle of the tree-beetle; to muse upon
some book of whose drift only a faint idea is intelligible,
content to leave its problems in the limbo of the insoluble,
where most of life's questions seethe harmlessly enough;
then, turning, give thanks to Allah, who has made gardens
for mankind, and doze again.</p>

<p>Farther on the path led us across streams banked
with maiden-hair fern like rank grass. Water had worn
the rock into grotesque shapes, a cavernous arch in one
place, the banks, like a tunnel, almost meeting over our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
heads in another. Immense blocks of stone barred the
way; it was not easy riding, but the mules climbed up
and down rocky staircases with much tact, while we sat
holding our breath.</p>

<p>Over one of these obstructions the breastplate of
my saddle, which had only been fastened to begin with
by three stitches of string, burst, and I found myself
almost over the grey's tail: such a common occurrence
that no Moor goes out without string and packing-needle
handy; but this was past mending on the road,
and I changed on to the soldier's mule, whose top-heavy
saddle was no fit at all, and, shifting all over its back,
required careful balance on the rider's part.</p>

<p>The road was only a few feet wide, and so overgrown
that, as we jogged one after the other, trying to dodge
grey arms of fig-trees, lying on the mules' necks under
dark masses of foliage which shut out half the light,
hatless, the stiffest bullfinch at home would have been
ears of corn compared with what we went through.</p>

<p>At last, however, it came to an end, and the trail
opened out into the village of Semsar. Nobody was to
be seen; dogs barked as usual; some kids bleated inside
a hut. We rode by the crazy hovels; a woman carrying
water emerged, and a boy with a baby. Beyond the last
brown erection we came to a saint's tomb. This meant
the village green without any "green." Two or three
country people sat in the usual meeting-place among
trodden-down weeds, talking and smoking their long pipes,
congregated round one busy man, who was chopping a
log into a plough with an axe. Around the tomb was
a group of olive-trees, preserved leaf and stick and all,
not a branch even of dead wood off the ground removed,
by reason of the sanctity of the spot. However small a
grove, it would otherwise have been cut down, as afford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>ing
cover to robbers and <i>ginns</i> (evil spirits). Thanks to
saints' tombs the traveller in Morocco still meets with
clumps and occasional woods of olives. The sunshine
glowed on their hoary twisted branches, and flecked the
gnarled trunks; the grey foliage cast patches of dense
shadow on the brown earth under the mammoths, whose
broken lines and odd elbows supported such masses of
quiet colour and solemn shade. We wound our way
to the left among the huts. Of any road between them
there was none; the mules could barely climb over some
of the boulders among the refuse.</p>

<p>Once quit of the "green," we saw no one again, and
got much mixed as to direction. Finally, we struck a
path with a descent into a pool and below a fig tree,
which, having made ourselves small, we circumvented,
and discovered that it meandered in time to the outside
of the village. Following, we wound southwards by a
gorge along a rocky stream, which has the reputation
of rising suddenly after rain, and not long ago drowned
three mules.</p>

<p>Stepping-stones are not provided in Morocco, and it
is generally a case of plunging through a stream to
reach the opposite side. Near a city with good fortune
a Jew may pass, the chance may be worth waiting for;
but no Mohammedan Moor would carry an infidel across
on his superior back.</p>

<p>In time a different path led us back to Tetuan, and
we rode in by the Mulberry Gate at sunset, as the
mueddzin was calling upon true believers to worship.</p>

<p>On fine days we made many such excursions, and
exploited the country for miles round. Showery and
doubtful days were devoted to the city and shopping.</p>

<p>Shopping in a foreign city tends towards the accumulation
of white elephants, which, safely landed in England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
work havoc in an English home. Long flint guns from
the Riff, and old blue dishes from Fez, and orange-striped
rugs from Rabat look strangely out of place with
wall-papers and oil paintings. The East will never sit
down with the West, and the adjuncts of either are bound
to "fight." And yet we shopped.</p>

<p>There are fewer more interesting ways of studying
the outside life of the people; a little gossip and less
reliable information are all thrown in to the bargain. The
little Tetuan shops are a species of club, for each Moor
has certain shops at which he habitually sits and may
be found with more or less certainty. While the owner
and his goods remain inside the shop, there is room for
two people outside on the sill or doorstep, and a couple
of fat leather cushions are provided for them. Even
Mr. Bewicke was in the habit of sitting every day at
Hadj Mukhtar Hilalli's shop and hearing the news,
between four and seven o'clock every evening.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-13.png"><img src="./images/ill-13_th.png" alt="OUT SHOPPING." title="OUT SHOPPING." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Out Shopping.</p>

<p>He interpreted for us in our early days. We spent a
whole morning buying <i>humbells</i> (striped carpets) at a shop
where the owner was sitting on the floor playing chess
with a friend and drinking green tea. All over Tetuan
draughts and chess are played constantly on little boards,
either on the doorstep or inside the shop. The game had
its origin, like bridge and polo, eastwards of England,
and was introduced into Europe after the Crusades,
together with baths and other civilized habits. Our
shopman looked exceedingly bored at the interruption.
However, after much bargaining, we bought a humbell,
having to point to everything we wished to buy, for no
Moor likes a Christian to come inside his shop, because
of his dirty boots. A Moor is either in a pair of clean
yellow slippers, or else they are on the doorsill, and his
feet are bare: he tosses all his silks, towels, embroideries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
carpets, on the floor, and sits among them, while the
purchaser stands outside, points to the shelves and heap,
and trusts to the owner's divining which particular silk
handkerchief is wanted.</p>

<p>In another shop we found a second humbell, chiefly
black and orange, the property of a taciturn individual
in a snow-white <i>selham</i> (hooded cloak), a turban to match,
with scarlet peak, a dark blue garment underneath the
selham, and a complexion like cream and roses. He lay
at full length on a pile of many carpets. We stopped
in front of the shop. Neither rising, bowing, nor bustling
about to show off his goods, the white figure lay still,
looking dreamily through and beyond us. We were
bores. In reply to a question of price, a long sum was
murmured. At last we expressed a decided wish to
inspect the humbell, and, slowly rising, he condescended
to lift it from a shelf, his looks suggesting that he would
prefer being left alone. Again we asked his lowest price.
Twenty-one shillings. We offered sixteen. Without
deigning to answer, he solemnly folded up the humbell
and put it away, then folded one by one the goods which
littered the floor, and stacked them above the humbell on
the same shelf. Still standing in front of the shop, we
repeated our offer of sixteen shillings. He shook his
head decidedly, made a deprecating gesture, and prepared
to sink again on his couch. Mr. Bewicke forbade us to
offer more; we walked away. A voice said in Arabic,
"It is yours," and the humbell was thrown after us; the
sixteen shillings were received with a sigh as the shopkeeper
resumed his couch.</p>

<p>Tetuan makes many artistic "towels," which form the
ordinary dress of the countrywomen underneath their old
enfolding yellowish-white woollen haiks; but for quite
the majority a towel as skirt and a towel as cape are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
sufficient for all purposes. There is the rare addition of
a pair of cotton drawers.</p>

<p>The strong substance and fast scarlet dyes make these
towels no mean substitutes for curtains, except that, like
native goods in general, they seldom quite match, and
distract the soul which demands "pairs" in all and
everything.</p>

<p>A Jew we visited in the Jews' Quarter had a fine carpet
for sale, made farther south, something like a Persian,
the ground whitish, with harmonious reds and greens.
For a long time we sat and tried to bargain in his
odd little den up a dilapidated staircase and nearly
pitch dark: he wanted &pound;5. The pattern was a little
small. We came away without it. Some of the old
<i>kaftans</i> (robes of coloured cloth or satin or silk brocade,
embroidered with gold or silver, buttoned down the front
and with wide sleeves) were well worth buying: none are
made like them nowadays, for common material is used;
unfortunately the best are often in tatters.</p>

<p>We visited the Slipper Market, and, sitting on the doorstep
of one of the shops, gave directions for two pairs&mdash;blue
velvet embroidered with gold, and milk-coloured leather
embroidered with green. Size, price, and colour were duly
discussed; rain came on, we sat on the doorsill sheltering,
and the basha&mdash;Tetuan's governor&mdash;was criticised. The
slipper-maker had not a good word for him. To begin
with, it seems he has no money, is of no family, and
aristocratic Tetuan refuses to "hob-nob" with him. He
dislikes Tetuan after Fez, whence he was transferred, and
where he made more money. The other day a neighbouring
tribe sent him a present of so many dollars. At the
same time they owed him certain taxes, in lieu of which
he accepted the money, but pointed out that the present
must follow in due course. None ever arrived, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
basha sent his brother-in-law and a soldier to the tribesmen
to ask an explanation of its non-appearance. The
brother-in-law was tactless, incensed the tribesmen, and
provoked them to bastinado him, whereupon the soldier
lost his head, and fired his gun off into the air. He was
promptly disembowelled.</p>

<p>The brother-in-law returned to the basha, stiff, but
alive; and the country people give it as their verdict that
the basha is a rapacious man. They threaten that they
will no longer bring their produce into Tetuan to market,
but will hold their own markets at some place chosen by
themselves out in the country, and Tetuan shall come out
to buy. Such a proceeding would be most inconvenient;
for Tetuan is dependent for all its supplies on the country
people, who hold their markets on Sundays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays in the feddan, where they sit upon the ground
packed in hundreds, their chickens, eggs, butter, and produce
in general in their laps and at their feet. Their beef
and mutton are but second-rate, and the shapeless lumps
of lean, tough meat take double as long as an English
joint to cook, and make but a poor show in the end, hacked
by the unskilful butchers past all recognition. Goat and
fish are to be had, sometimes partridges, hares, and rabbits,
occasionally a haunch of wild boar. Fish came in on
certain days when the wind was favourable: there was
then a rush on the fish market, and almost a free fight
over the great panniers full of shining silvery sardines, and
over the bodies of the sellers seated on the ground. The
successful carried off a handful each, and the caf&eacute;s and
fish shops were soon frying sardines for dear life, while
the little streets were thick with the steam of native oil
and butter. Some big fish, four and five feet long, came
into market sometimes, and a small boy would be hired
by a purchaser to carry one home across his shoulder, its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
great head hanging down behind, and underneath a pair
of thin brown legs like little sticks hurrying along the
street.</p>

<p>Bread in Morocco is "passing heavy," flavoured with
aniseed and full of grit. Vegetables are to be had in
abundance.</p>

<p>The slippers, which had been promised in three days,
appeared in three weeks. Whenever we passed the shop
we asked after them: always the same answer&mdash;<i>M&#257;nana</i>
(To-morrow). "No, there was no butter to be had to-day,
but <i>m&#257;nana</i>." "No, the pillows were not finished yet, but
<i>m&#257;nana</i>." "The boots left to be soled were not ready,
but <i>m&#257;nana</i>." Tetuan lives upon <i>m&#257;nana</i>: it is the reincarnation
of <span class="smcap">jam yesterday, and jam to-morrow,
but never jam to-day</span>.</p>

<p>Equally exasperating was the habit of every shopkeeper
of locking up his shop and going off to pray or eat or
chat. If a shop had to be revisited and purchases
exchanged, the owner was invariably out, and the door
fastened with lock and key. At 12.15 <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'a.m.'">p.m.</ins> nobody could
ever be found, but was presumably at the mosque. Again
and again we visited the same shop: one day the owner
was at a friend's shop, the next at home, and so on. We
gave him up, to see his sleek cross-legged figure seated
inside the little cupboard the very next time we passed.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-14.png"><img src="./images/ill-14_th.png" alt="SHOPS IN TETUAN." title="SHOPS IN TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Shops in Tetuan.</p>

<p>Walking by a saint-house on the outskirts of the city,
devout and impoverished women were often to be seen
there, visiting the shrine and carrying with them small
vessels of food, which they placed on the ground for the
spirit of the holy man to eat. The window of the shrine
was tied with a hundred scraps of rag and dead flowers,
bits of wood, and paper and oddments of all sorts.
Empty earthenware bowls later on, and pariah dogs skulking
around, licking their lips, told a tale; but if asked if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
they really thought their saint would come up out of
his grave and eat the food prepared for him, it was open
to the Mussulman to answer the Christian, "And do
you really believe that your dead friends come and smell
the flowers you plant on their graves?"</p>

<p>Small-pox kills a great many Moors, and an incredible
number are marked by the disease. It is looked upon
much as measles are in England: cases are never isolated,
and children are all expected to have it. Each year it is
prevalent, and people may be passed in the street with
it out upon them; but every four years it breaks out
seriously, and a large percentage of the population dies.</p>

<p>Last of all, in our shopping days a few things we
bought by auction. No auctioneer is employed as in
European countries, but the owner and seller himself
perambulates the street or courtyard with his goods&mdash;a
mule, or a frying-pan, or a carpet&mdash;calling out each
successive bid which he receives on his article, pushing
his way and jostling the motley mob of market people,
peasants and loungers, silks and rags, until he has got
his price, and hands over to its new owner his late
possession.</p>

</div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had not been long at the fonda before the
Fast of R&aacute;madhan began. R&aacute;madhan, ordained
by Mohammed, takes place in the ninth month of every
Mohammedan year, and lasts for twenty-eight days,
during which time the Faithful fast from dawn, when it
is light enough to distinguish between a black and white
thread, to sunset. It alters by a few days every year
according to the moon, and when it falls during summer
in scorching hot countries the agonies of thirst endured
mean a penance indeed.</p>

<p>R&aacute;madhan begins when the new moon is first seen.
Tidings were sent from Tangier to say that it had been
observed there, which tidings Tetuan handed on to the
farthest mountain villages: a gun was fired from the
Kasbah at sunset, horns were sounded, and R&aacute;madhan
began. It sometimes happens that Tetuan does not see
the new moon till the day after Tangier has seen it at
the beginning of the fast, in which case the Tetuan
people are guilty of "eating the head of R&aacute;madhan":
this year it was not so. During the twenty-eight days
of the fast, every night, or rather every early morning at
2 a.m., the householder was awakened by the crashing
of his knocker on his door and a shout bidding him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
"Rise and eat": the mueddzin at the same time from
the top of the mosque called the hour of prayer, and
long brass horns brayed to the same effect.</p>

<p>The month was almost over before we had learnt to
sleep through it all. As the fonda was in the Moorish
Quarter our door was not exempt. Far away up the
street the knockers clanked, nearer and nearer every
moment, then the man's footsteps, then our own knocker
sounded like a sledge-hammer, and "Rise and eat" followed:
the man went on to the next door, and back again
shortly up the opposite side of the street. And every
Mussulman arose in the dark and had a large meal.
Again at sunrise the big gun boomed from the Kasbah,
the concussion shaking our ill-built room, and we woke
once more.</p>

<p class="sc">A Cluster of Country Women.</p>

<p>No doubt the original motive of fasting and abstinence
in the Old Testament was the promotion of sanitary
conditions. It is not good to eat pig in hot countries:
thus pork was "unclean," and is to-day in Morocco.
Nor is the consumption of much spirituous liquor wise
when the thermometer marks a hundred and one: hence
the Kor&#257;n forbids the use of strong drinks. The same
motive underlies the fast, which rests and relieves systems
over-fattened and little exercised. But the "all or nothing"
theory which governs the uneducated and knows no
moderation runs a benefit into an abuse. R&aacute;madhan
had its disadvantages. Tetuan was revelling at night and
in a sodden sleep through the day; work was slipshod
and at sixes and sevens; men were irritable and quarrelsome;
every one looked indisposed; and the excuse for
it all was always R&aacute;madhan. Worst of all, the countrywomen
still tramped four and five hours into market
with loads, and children a month old, only half nourished
at the time of the fast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
But R&aacute;madhan came to an end at last: Morocco breathed
again. The day before the fast was over everybody
was smiling, and Tetuan had but one hope, that the new
moon would be seen that night, and thus the month of
penance come to an end. After the letter from Tangier
had been received next morning, which said that the new
moon had been seen there, the gun from the fort thundered,
the basha went in gorgeous state to the <i>Jama-el-Kebeer</i>
(Big Mosque) on a white mule, all caparisoned in blue,
and read aloud the letter, the city was uproarious, and
the mountains echoed again, for soldiers were sent post-haste
up the valleys, and fired all day at intervals to
notify to the fathermost villages that R&aacute;madhan was over.</p>

<p>And the next day! The first day of the <i>Aid-el-Sereer</i>
(Little Feast)! Everybody was in shining white, if
not new, apparel, and all Tetuan was abroad. That
among a people clad so largely in white and in gorgeous
colours means a great deal, and the streets of Tetuan
might have competed with the Park on the Sunday before
Ascot. The Moorish crowd was almost entirely a male
one, dressed like peacocks: satins embroidered with gold
and silver prevailed.</p>

<p>And if the snowy haiks and turbans and the resplendent
shades of the kaftans were the first point about the feast,
the sweetmeat stalls were the second. A Moor is a born
sweet-tooth, and at every corner of the streets a board
was stacked with creamy mixtures in which walnuts were
embedded, with generously browned toffee full of almonds,
with carmine-coloured sticks, with magenta squares of
sweet peppermint, with blocks of nougat inches thick.
And the joys of the feast seemed amply to compensate
for the fast.</p>

<p>Mohammed ordained many minor feasts and fasts.
R&aacute;madhan stands out chief of the one: <i>Aid-el-Kebeer</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
(Great Feast), falling two months and six days afterwards,
is chief of the other.</p>

<p>The three reforms which Mohammed instituted were
temperance, cleanliness, and monotheism, at a time when
reform was badly needed. He was born in Mecca five
hundred and seventy years after Christ, an Arab of the
tribe of Beni Has`sim. Christianity was not unknown
around him in his day.</p>

<p>Always somewhat of a visionary and introspective turn
of mind, when he was about forty years old he became
deeply interested in the subject of religion. Living in
the imaginative East, in a hotbed of mysticism and superstition,
it was easy for him to conceive himself a chosen
vessel of the Almighty, and to assume by degrees the
r&ocirc;le of prophet, in the honest belief that the words he
uttered came direct from that God whose mouthpiece he
conceived himself to be. A small band of followers by
degrees collected round him, and in the ordinary course
of events his end would have been that of a saint with
a tombstone white; but, added to the saint's fanaticisms,
Mohammed possessed the talents of a leader, and the
ambition which accompanies those talents.</p>

<p>Men and more men were attracted to him; he instituted
among them a ceremonial of prayer, feasts, and fasts, and
built a mosque at Medina, in which they worshipped.
Persecution from their fellow-countrymen followed as a
matter of course, and Mohammed's disciples, who began
to call themselves Mohammedans, turned to him as their
chief. The one "able man," he naturally assumed the
position of a theocratic ruler, and led them against their
enemies; while the words he spoke were committed to
memory, constituting later on the Kor&#257;n.</p>

<p>As a general Mohammed was successful: battle after
battle was fought and won, reverses were amply com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>pensated
for, and men flocked to his standard, while
deputations from surrounding tribes poured in upon him,
acknowledging his supremacy, and asking for instruction
in his creed.</p>

<p>That creed was admirably adapted to suit the manners,
opinions, and vices of the East: it was extraordinarily
simple, it proposed but few truths in which belief
was necessary, and it laid no severe restraints upon the
natural desires of men; above all, its warlike tendencies
captivated the men of its day, and war, which at first
had been necessary in self-defence, was still carried on,
and gradually came to be looked upon by Mohammed
and his followers as a lawful means towards spreading
their religion. In the name of a <i>Holy War</i> the conquerors
offered their defeated enemies the option of death or
embracing the new religion, while the women and children
taken in battle were sold as slaves, after the manner
of the time.</p>

<p>And the Prophet's influence deepened and extended.
Meanwhile, his sayings, or "the Kor&#257;n," were written
down from time to time by one or other of his followers,
on palm leaves, on stone tablets, on the shoulder-plates
of goats and camels, and even tattooed on men's breasts;
while his ritual was strictly carried out&mdash;prayer with
absolution, frequent washing, fasting, almsgiving, the
pilgrimage to Mecca, and the recital of the formula
"There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his
prophet."</p>

<p>Prayer was offered up five times a day, as now, by
every true believer&mdash;at sunrise, at midday, at three in
the afternoon, at sunset, and two hours after sunset:
the <i>adzan</i> (call to prayers) was chanted at each time
by the mueddzin from the minarets of the mosques. The
first thing in the morning at sunrise the call ran, "God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
is great; God is great. Mohammed is his prophet.
Prayer is better than sleep. Come to prayer; come to
prayer." The believer, obeying the summons, washes,
enters the mosque, and repeats from four to eight short
prayers, with genuflections between each.</p>

<p>Mohammed strictly obeyed the forms of his doctrine,
and himself performed the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca
and the ceremonies round the K&#257;aba. He was familiar
with at least part of the Gospels, but his knowledge was
possibly scant and distorted: he was unfriendly towards
Christians. For the Old Testament he had a profound
respect.</p>

<p>As far as can be gathered he was a sober and meditative
man: he sought neither state nor riches for himself,
when either might have been his for the asking. He
looked upon women from a point of view not unlike the
characters in the Old Testament&mdash;a distinctly Eastern
one. He possessed five wives, and probably concubines&mdash;bondwomen
in much the same position as Hagar of old.</p>

<p>Mohammed instituted the veiling of women, with corresponding
restrictions on domestic intercourse, as a check
upon undue sexual licence&mdash;the curse of hot climates.</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that Mohammed was
not honest in the conviction that his mission was divine,
and that, if he countenanced vindictive revenge, rapine,
and lust as a means towards the furtherance of his
teaching, he justified the act in his own mind by what
he believed to be revelations from a spirit other than
his own.</p>

<p>A great character has perforce its great faults, and
the courage and ambition which made so mighty a leader
were naturally enough the rock upon which that leader
split, blinding his eyes and distorting his point of view,
leading him into compromise and error. But though self-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>deceived
and fanatical, it is improbable that Mohammed
was insincere. By the spirit of his day he must be
judged. His day believed in him.</p>

<p>He died early in the seventh century, sixty-three years
old, saying, "Verily I have fulfilled my mission. I have
left that amongst you, a plain command, the Book of
God, and manifest ordinances, which, if ye hold fast, ye
shall never go astray." Within two years of his death
the Mohammedan armies had overrun Syria; Egypt
was in their possession, and the whole northern coast
of Africa.</p>

<p>The scraps which contained in writing the sayings of
the dead Prophet were all collected by his chief
amanuensis: his followers appointed three judges to
overlook the work. The new collection was written in
Mohammed's own pure Meccan dialect, and every spurious
copy was burnt. So carefully was this done that there
is but one and the same Kor&#257;n throughout the vast
Mohammedan world.</p>

<p>Mohammedanism satisfied the East for two reasons:
first, because it was a warlike religion, and therefore
appealed to warlike tribes; secondly, because, deeply
underlying it, was the strong, calm spirit of fatalism, that
world-old foundation-stone on which many a man has
come to anchor. The very word Mussulman means,
"One who has surrendered himself and his will to God."</p>

<p>There are no subtle intricacies in such a creed, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
mysterious contradictions to puzzle the uneducated mind;
it amply satisfies a simple people; and probably no other
dogma makes so many converts.</p>

<p>In Morocco to-day the Mohammedan religion is interwoven
with the whole fabric of life. To the Moor Allah
is always present, is behind every decree of the Sultan,
and enters into the smallest detail of his own private life
to such a degree that barely a single action is performed
without invoking the sacred name. Religion is, according
to the temper of the individual Moor, "a passion, or a
persuasion, or an excuse, but never a check": for a man
may commit any sin under heaven, and "Allah is
merciful; Mohammed is his prophet; all will be forgiven."
And this is not hypocritical: the larger soul includes the
smaller&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>It follows as a natural sequence that, because Allah is
as much part of a Moor's life as the air he breathes, he
is forgotten. The repetition of words bulks so largely in
Mohammedanism, that, as with the Jews of old, the letter
of the law has killed the spirit. The evil of Mohammed's
religion lies in its essential antagonism towards progress
and civilization: scientific investigation is forbidden; a
proverb runs, "Only fools and the very young speak the
truth." Thus Mohammedanism will never advance or
regenerate Morocco; for these tenets are Government
policy.</p>

<p>At the same time there is in Mohammedan society a
certain negative virtue which contrasts strongly with the
gross immorality existing in Christian countries. The
conditions of what is lawful for a Mohammedan are wide
enough to content, and extremes offer no temptation.
Polygamy, divorce, and slavery are all allowed, and war
upon unbelievers is enjoined as a duty. And yet "social
evils" and the lowest depths to which humanity falls are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>
almost unknown in Morocco; while what is held to be
sin is rigorously punished&mdash;adultery by stoning (a father
has no hesitation in shooting his daughter himself),
robbery by mutilation, and so on.</p>

<p>Unlike many Christian churches, a Moorish mosque is
never closed: the sanctuary is always open. It is council-chamber,
meeting-place, and for travellers at night
resting-place. There are no priests in the European
sense; but the <i>basha</i> (governor) or the <i>kadi</i> (judge) reads
prayers on Fridays, a sermon follows, and letters or
decrees from the Sultan are given out in the mosque after
service.</p>

<p>The treatment of Mohammedan women, against which
so much has been written, is after all Oriental, and nothing
more. The Kor&#257;n speaks of woman as an inferior
being, an incomplete creation, needing no education, to be
rigorously and jealously guarded all her life, and who after
death may or may not be admitted into the Mohammedan
heaven. Her function, if rich, is to bear children, and to
be treated like a petted lap-dog: if poor, to work as a
labourer. But interrogate the wife of a rich Moor on the
subject, and she will not have the slightest wish to educate
herself, but will affirm emphatically, "We have children
and enough to eat. Why should we want to learn
anything?"</p>

<p>It is manifestly absurd to compare Mohammedanism
with Christianity, which are each the outcome of a distinct
race, divided by that greatest barrier&mdash;a racial gulf.</p>

<p>Christianity, it must be confessed, bearing in mind the
Christian renegades with whom the Moor has traded, is
looked upon by him for the most part as a thing beneath
contempt. It had five hundred years, before Mohammed
was born, in which to impress itself on the East. It signally
failed. And yet only a few years after Mohammed's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
death his religion had taken by storm Egypt, Turkey,
Arabia, Persia, Turkestan, parts of India, the Malay
Peninsula, the north coast of Africa, and parts of China,
introducing monotheism, and impressing temperance
and cleanliness on uncivilized millions, but never
advancing beyond that point. It is borne in upon one
that, in spite of missionary effort, Morocco will change
its religion for that of Christianity when, as its own
proverb says, "The charcoal takes root and the salt buds."
The East, when it adopts other tenets, will exchange
its own for a wider and a more universal cult than
that which modern sects and parties are endeavouring
and failing to introduce to-day.</p>

<p>While we were in our small quarters at the fonda,
the weather by no means came up to the high standard
it is said to reach in December. A few sunny days,
when we could bask out of doors, were grudgingly
sandwiched between many wet ones, and again and
again the R&aacute;madhan sunrise gun awoke us to gouts
of almost tropical rain, a fiery sunrise followed by an
hour's brilliant sunshine, the herald of a shamelessly
distorted April day. The little gutters down the middle
of the streets ran like torrents, carrying off chickens'
heads and cabbage-stalks; hail scoured the pebbles;
outside the city "the dry land was over your boots";
the road to the sea was impassable, and the rivers between
Tangier and Tetuan were unfordable; snow lay in patches
on the mountains; half the vale was inundated; the
river could be heard a mile away; both our windows
leaked; and down in the little patio, where the family
sat, the waters were out.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-16.png"><img src="./images/ill-16_th.png" alt="A TYPICAL MOORISH STREET." title="A TYPICAL MOORISH STREET." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">A Typical Moorish Street.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><i>Photo by A. Cavilla, Tangier.</i></p>

<p>From the west coast at Saffi terrible reports arrived
of the havoc the weather had made of the city. The
lowest barometer ever seen had preceded sheets of rain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
and a solid <i>hamla</i> (flood) had entered the gates from the
valley above, filling the narrow streets in a few moments
to a depth of seven and eight feet, and carrying everything
before it: men, women, children, and cattle were swept
in a torrent through the water-gate out to sea, sometimes
a hand stretched out above the eddies. Then the gate
became blocked with floating <i>debris</i> and bodies, and the
flood rose to ten feet in the principal street. The townspeople
who survived took refuge on their roofs. The vice-governor
was drowned. Houses, shops, mills, and mosques
were gutted as if by fire; furniture and household goods
were ruined; the Saffi shopkeepers were beggared. For
many weeks after the survivors starved upon roots, in
spite of a subscription raised in Tangier to relieve them.</p>

<p>The rain apparently was something like a waterspout.
Happily Tetuan was exempt from waterspouts, and on
days when the rain gave over for a time we rode, or,
picking our way along the muddy streets, drank tea
with some Moor.</p>

<p>One dull afternoon we sampled the state of the roads
outside, R. on a donkey, and Mr. Bewicke and myself
on foot. Walking out by the Gate of the Tombs, we
bore to the left, and dived into the narrowest of narrow
lanes, shut in with tall cane fences and high mud-banks
crowned with prickly pear, the shape of whose fat,
fleshy leaves recalls moles' paws.</p>

<p>The donkey was an unusually large one, and its
pack rolled more than packs in general: before we saw
the last of Tetuan its rider had many a fall off her
unsteady perch; and if there is truth in the Moorish
saying that "one does not become a horseman till
one is broken," R. may claim to have qualified. It
shied and bucked and came on its nose over rocks;
but this time Mr. Bewicke's boy, Mohr, directed its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
ways, and thoroughly enjoyed cudgelling it along with
a stick, helped by its rider's switch, cut from a quince-tree,
which often as not hit Mohr instead of the ass.</p>

<p>By-and-by we met a countryman, his wife, and a
donkey. The woman, who wore little except two
striped towels, and a handkerchief round her head,
staggered along under a great load of faggots. She
was stunted and wrinkled, removed mentally but few
degrees from the three-year-old weather-beaten donkey
which minced along in front of her, also loaded with
faggots. The woman had strips of rough leather
bandaged round her legs to protect them from thorns.
Her feet were bare. Her husband sauntered last of
all, presumably looking after the donkey: he had no
load. Another time the donkey also might be exempt,
while the woman was still burdened; and the man, when
asked why, if he would not carry the load himself, he
did not at least put it upon the donkey, would reply,
"Because it is too heavy for the ass."</p>

<p>A little farther on and a magnificent Riffi passed us,
walking along at a smart pace into the city, his face
"old oak" colour, framed in a turban of dark red-brown
strings of wool. He wore a chocolate-coloured jellab,
embroidered at the edge with white, and sewn with
tufts of red, violet, yellow, and green-coloured silks:
a tall, wiry fellow, with a back like a ram-rod, a thin
face, and keen, defiant eyes. The light glittered on
his long, brass-plated Riffi gun: a red leather pouch
full of bullets hung at his side. He was a great
contrast to the labourer who passed us afterwards, also
bound for the city&mdash;an old and grizzled monkey-faced
man, with his head tied round with a ragged red cloth
gun-case. His jellab hung in tatters, but he also carried
a gun, and by a string a brace of partridges and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
wild duck, which "bag," after some bargaining, became
ours for the sum of one-and-sixpence.</p>

<p>Among the brown jellabs and varied turbans European
clothes were forcibly out of their place: a people like
the Moors, childlike, patriarchal, whose lives embody
one of the oldest and perhaps best ideas of a simple
existence, may well hate the sight, on the face of their
select country, of prosaic tailoring and hideous head-gear.
The traveller in his boots, where boots are things unknown,
passes the muffled women with their silent gait,
the picturesque ruffians with their swinging stride, and
is unable to help feeling not at home and something of a
blot on the landscape.</p>

<p>The lane we wandered up had been, and was still
in places, a watercourse, and we struggled along the
steep chasms gouged out of the soft soil, and clambered
over rocks which had withstood the torrent.</p>

<p>By-and-by a red door intervened on our left, fitted into
an imposing whitewashed arched gateway, with a mounting-block
on each side, and the great brass ring-shaped
knocker in the middle of the door which the Moors have
left all over Spain&mdash;the garden-house of the French Consul.
In another four months, when all aristocratic Tetuan would
migrate in a body into their "summer-houses," and by
their mutual presence reassure each other as to their
safety, the Consul would move out of the city: at present
he would look on such a step as sheer madness.</p>

<p>An old negro slave, with a beard like cotton-wool, was
at work in the garden, and, opening the door, let us in
to look round. A wide gravel path led up to the dazzling
walls of the house, spotless as a sheet of glazed cream-laid
note-paper, the window-frames and door picked out with
Reckitt's blue. A white railing in front edged the terrace,
the steps of which were tanned by the damp salt air a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
fine rusty ochre. The house inside was built on the
invariable Moorish lines&mdash;kitchen and inferior rooms on
the ground floor, one great lofty room above, and the
flat roof over all. A garden-room flanked the house on
the south-east, the front open to the garden, pillared and
arched with the old white plastered "horse-shoe." In underneath
the arches were shade and cool tiling, and outside
more tiled ground suggested steaming brews of fragrant
green tea, tiny glasses, low tables, and long divans spread
under the sky.</p>

<p>It was a grey day, and height beyond height on into
the Riff country was cloud-capped, while <i>shar d'jebel</i> (the
hair of the mountain, as the Moors call snow) whitened
a few furrowed peaks. The flats lay below to the left,
and a horizontal blue pencil line was scored beyond them.
Cow-birds stalked about the garden among some new
vines which the old negro was putting in.</p>

<p>We sat down on the terrace, looking at the view, and
the silence of the place was above all things most striking.
A cavalcade of mules tailed away in the distance in single
file along the faint track to the sea; the packed white
city lay to the right, but no voices reached us; here
cart-wheels, railway-trains, threshing-machines, and busy
farm life were not. It would have been hard to age
and wrinkle in such a spot&mdash;Adam and Eve might have
felt at home.</p>

<p>It was also a weedy one, this Paradise: a tangle of
greenery spread underneath the oranges, hanging like
yellow trimming on a green fabric, choking the vines and
a few scarlet geraniums. Labour, in such indolent and
self-possessed acres, was a crude and gauche idea.</p>

<p>The greybeard with the marmoset face and leathern
apron let us out at the red door: he had a history. His
master, a prosperous Moor, once offered to free him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
the old slave refused the offer, on the score that he was
quite content as he was. However, his master urged him
to accept, and he was eventually given his freedom. But
later on the master lost all his money, and ruin was
before him. His old slave came back. "See here, my
master; here am I. Take me; sell me"; and he finally
persuaded the man to sell him. He seemed contented
enough as the property of the French Consul, who is a
Moor.</p>

<p>We passed a party of closely veiled women, as we
strolled citywards, taking advantage of a break in the
wet weather to visit their gardens, carrying a great
key, and accompanied by two or three ink-black slaves,
fine upstanding women, well fed and clothed, looking
good-tempered to a fault, whose children, by the same
husband and master, would rank equally with those of
the wives.</p>

<p>Mohammedan women, though veiled and supervised,
have at least their gardens to saunter out to and visit
when the tracks allow. Jewesses in Morocco deserve
infinitely more pity. Their one recreation seemed to
consist in walking as far as the Jewish cemetery, ten
minutes outside the Gate of the Tombs, and attending
to the gravestones of their friends.</p>

<p>The cemetery is gradually absorbing one side of a
rough red-earthed hill; it has no fence of any description
round it, and the flat pale-blue and white tombstones
spread over the ground look in the distance like so much
washing out to dry. The stones are all alike, oblong
lozenges, inscribed in Hebrew.</p>

<p>Here, especially on Fridays, the women's day, Jewesses
congregate, flocking along the cemetery road&mdash;the
mourners in ponderous black skirts, vast breadths of
crimson silk let into the fronts and embroidered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
gold, white shawls over head and forehead, a yellow sash-end
edged with red appearing behind, and completing
their mourning. Some of the shawls are family heirlooms,
and only parted with for five-pound notes.</p>

<p>Loud checks and gaudy colours adorn the Rahels,
Donahs, Zulicas, and Miriams not in mourning, as well
as the white shawls; and the procession troops to the
cemetery, sallow, sad-eyed daughters of Jacob, talking a
mixture of Arabic and Spanish, with a few English and
Shillah words thrown in.</p>

<p>Of all life's unfortunates, the Jew in Morocco was once,
next to the negro in the West Indies, the most persecuted
and degraded of God's creatures.</p>

<p>In Tangier and the seaport towns, where the Christian
representatives countenance and support him, the Jew,
subject to certain restrictions, is in the present day a
flourishing member of the community; but in the interior
his fate is still a hard one.</p>

<p>There is a Jewish tradition that when Shalmaneser,
King of Assyria, conquered the Israelites, the tribe of
Naphthali took refuge in the interior of Africa, and spread
to Morocco. Jewish tombstones are certainly to be
found dating as far back as twelve hundred years, and
one synagogue possesses fragments of the Old Testament
written on parchment, while there is a population of
from four to five thousand Jews in the Atlas Mountains
who have lived there since time immemorial.</p>

<p>Perhaps the wandering Jew merely drifted into Morocco
just as he drifts all over the universe, and he would
have taken refuge in North Africa more particularly
when Spanish persecution became intolerable.</p>

<p>Once in Morocco, the Moors permitted the Jews to
remain because they were useful to them; but upon
certain conditions. They are confined to a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
quarter of the city&mdash;the Jews' Quarter, the Ghetto in
fact&mdash;which is shut and locked by a gate at sunset, barring
them from the outer world. In their own quarter they
may do as they like, except ride a horse; the horse
is considered too noble an animal to be ridden by the
Jew: outside they may not ride at all, not even a mule,
but are obliged to trudge barefoot through the slush of
the rest of the city, summer and winter. They are compelled
to wear one costume&mdash;a long black gabardine and
a black skull-cap. Few Jewesses care to leave their
quarters by themselves, for fear of insult. No synagogues
or public places of worship are allowed them, and they
must address Moors as <i>Sidi</i>, or "My lord."</p>

<p>But these customs are fast dying out. There is one
which universally obtains: the Jews' Quarter is known
as the <i>Mellah</i>; Mellah means "salt" in Arabic,&mdash;the Jews
are compelled to salt the heads of conquered tribes
killed in battle, and of criminals, which are afterwards
nailed on the city walls as trophies and warnings.</p>

<p>In Tetuan the Jews are influential and well treated:
many of them wear European clothes. On Saturday&mdash;the
Jewish Sabbath&mdash;a young masher (a Mordejai, or
Baruch, or Isaac) would boast a pair of brand-new yellow
shoes and white socks, but wear at the same time a
dove-coloured gabardine down to his heels and a mauve
sash round his waist. Claret-coloured gabardines were
fashionable, and a black skull-cap inevitable.</p>

<p>Though Tetuan was lax and liberal in its treatment
of the Israelites, wealthy families of whom it possessed,
the Mellah was at once the noisiest and filthiest quarter
of the city, teeming with children (unlike the Moorish
quarters, where there are few), who played and fought,
laughed and cried, by fifties down the three principal
arteries of the quarter, whose few feet of walking-space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
were lined with small and dirty greengrocers' and butchers'
shops, their stock-in-trade encrusted with flies. On hot days
the Mellah stank; on wet it was deep in black slime.</p>

<p>Once upon a time it ran close to the Jama-el-Kebeer;
and when a hundred years ago the Sultan who had built
the big mosque sent his envoy to examine it, all was
approved of except the proximity of the Jews' Quarter.
"Can a mosque be admired near Jews?" was speedily
answered by the Tetuanites, who turned the Israelites
neck and crop out of house and home, giving them
another piece of ground walled in and sufficiently removed.</p>

<p>The sons of Abraham are only tolerated all the world
over. As a nation, Moors loathe them. To a pig, which
they count "unclean," they give the epithet of <i>jew</i>:
out pig-sticking, when the pig breaks, the beaters shout,
"The jew! the jew!" To begin with, having forced his
presence on an unwilling people, the Jew retains his own
exclusiveness, neither marries a Moor nor eats with a
Moor, nor treats him as anything else except unclean.
Not only this, but by unscrupulous cunning Jews contrive
to exercise a maddening oppression over a people
with whom they have chosen to cast in their lot, swindling,
extorting money, and playing a hundred low tricks upon
the very race on the produce of whose labour they live:
at the same time their exasperating patience and cringing
humility, court contempt and insult.</p>

<p>The poorest Moor in Tetuan is a gentleman: the
richest Jew is not. But he has his good points: a
great sense of brotherhood, a strong bond of freemasonry
among the Jewish nation, undaunted energy, and an unshaken
faith in their religion are all admirable points in
themselves. Energy in Tetuan was concentrated in the
Mellah. The best workmen were all Jews. A hundred
things were sold by them which no Moor made.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
Thus in their Ghetto live the Chosen People, the
Separate People, of strange and ancient customs,&mdash;leaving
the hair uncut for a year after a relative's death, sitting
on the floor, and not on a chair, for a week after; twisting
a pocket-handkerchief round the waist on the Sabbath
in order to save "the work" of carrying it; slitting the
button-hole of the waistcoat in time of distress instead
of "rending the garment"; eating <i>adafina</i> on the Sabbath,
an indigestible dish of hard-boiled eggs, meat, and potatoes
prepared overnight and left on the fire till next morning.</p>

<p>There is no end to ceremonials throughout a Jew's
life: the first at his circumcision, the next when his
hair is cut for the first time, the next when he goes to
the synagogue for the first time, and so on.</p>

<p>When a Jew was buried in Tetuan, the uncoffined
body, wrapped in sheets on a wooden bier, might only
be borne out of the city by the <i>B&aacute;b-el-Je'f</i>, literally the
Gate of the Unclean Dead&mdash;that is, the Jews' Gate.</p>

<p>The mourners howled and the male relatives cried
aloud; friends followed, talking and smoking cigarettes.
It happened sometimes that the grave was not ready when
the cort&egrave;ge reached the cemetery, and that the party
would sit down on the hillside while it was lengthened
and deepened; from time to time the body would be
measured with a walking-stick, and the result compared
with the grave.</p>

<p>It is impossible to write about the Jews and omit one
certain point. Before the traveller has lived a week
in Morocco he begins to hear of <i>protection</i>, and he
carries with him vague words&mdash;"protected Jews" and
"protected Moors"&mdash;which one sentence can explain.
<i>Protection</i> means that a European living in Morocco, a
Portuguese, a Frenchman, an Englishman&mdash;it matters
not&mdash;has it in his power to make the Jew or the Moor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
desiring protection a nominal citizen of that country,
Portugal or France or what not, and can allow him
the rights of a citizen and the protection of the same;
while it follows that the Sultan and the Moorish Government
have no more power to touch him than they have
to touch a French or an English subject, the protected
Jew or Moor being outside their jurisdiction, and only
answerable to the consul of that country which has given
him protection, whether Germany, France, or any other.
The advantage of protection is to guarantee thereby
the safety of property. It was instituted a hundred
years and more ago, to obviate the difficulties and
dangers incurred by Europeans in trading with Jews
and Moors in a country so badly governed as Morocco.
Supposing that a European went into partnership and
traded with a Jew or a Moor who was unprotected, in
course of time, when the Jew or Moor became rich,
the Moorish Government would hear of it, and set to
work systematically to bleed him. Naturally the European
partner would lose money in the general robbery. Therefore
<i>protection</i>.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a Jew of property in Morocco who
is not protected, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of protected Moors; but though many Moors have enjoyed
security for themselves and their belongings by this
means, others less fortunate, more especially some years
ago, have only escaped the talons of Moorish despotism
to fall into the clutches of European swindlers, adventurers
who have dared&mdash;themselves somewhat beyond the
reach of their own home government&mdash;to fleece the
unsuspecting Mohammedan, bribing some basha to imprison
him for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>A European consul has before now "sold" his Moorish
protected partner&mdash;that is, he tells him that, if he does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
not produce so much money within a certain time, protection
will be withdrawn. The wiser course for the
Moor is to pay the sum. If protection is withdrawn,
the Moorish Government and the European blackleg will
divide his worldly goods between them.</p>

<p>Such risks are minimized every year, and protection
is greatly sought after by Moors and Jews. From the
French they get it easily enough. The system is a bad
one: that it prevails at all is a proof of the corruption of
the Moorish Government.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Why curse? <i>Mektub.</i> (It is written.)</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of the attentions of Amanda, as December drew
on and the weather showed no signs of clearing, we
began to hanker after a week at Gibraltar, which should
combine Christmas and the purchase of camp outfit for
use when the rains passed over. It was not difficult to
tear ourselves away from the fonda; for it became less
easy to tolerate the proximity of the old Spanish band-master,
with his bad tobacco and long-winded stories;
nor were our landlady and family over-refined. We
had not come to Morocco to live amongst the scum of
Spain: could Tetuan be swept clean of the Spanish
element, it were better for it. In fine, amusing and even
interesting though our quarters had been for the time,
circumstances pointed towards a move into others, the
interval being spent in a run across to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The steamers which call at Martine, down on the seashore,
and bring goods to be carted up to Tetuan, six
miles inland, are as mysterious as they are rare. One is
supposed to call on alternate Tuesdays, weather permitting;
another occasionally calls in the intervening weeks; none
come direct from Gibraltar, though all are supposed to
go straight back there after touching at Ceuta. But there
are many buts. Worst of all, the river at Martine has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
formed a bar, and Martine is a "bar port": this prevents
landing in a strong wind.</p>

<p>We pinned our faith upon the Tuesday boat, not
realizing its uncertainty; for if the boat had not enough
cargo on board to make it worth while her calling, or if
she had too much and time was short, or if the weather
was bad, she had no hesitation in missing Martine and
Tetuan out of that fortnight's round altogether.</p>

<p>We did not want to ride forty-four miles to Tangier
with the "roads" in the state they were, even if it had
been practicable; nor almost as far and a worse track
to Ceuta: either would have meant sleeping a night in
the fond&acirc;k up in the hills, or in a Spanish lodging-house
of doubtful repute: therefore we planned to go by boat
from Martine, engaged rooms for a week in Gibraltar
beforehand, and, with the optimism born of ignorance,
doubted not but that we should get away on the steamer.</p>

<p>Packing up overnight and breakfasting at eight, we
were soon ready to mount our mules and ride down
to the shore to catch our boat. It was a matter of two
and a half hours from Tetuan down to Martine: the
track need not be described&mdash;this speaks for itself. Our
luggage, tied with complicated rope-knots, was judiciously
balanced upon one mule, and we had said good-bye to
Amanda and family when a message arrived from the
steamships agency to say that the steamer was not in.</p>

<p>After taking counsel, however, the luggage was dispatched
down to Martine; a muleteer badly marked with
small-pox climbed on the top of our worldly goods, and
the mule jogged off: we would follow when the steamer
was sighted.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-18.png"><img src="./images/ill-18_th.png" alt="REFUSE GOING OUT OF TETUAN." title="REFUSE GOING OUT OF TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Refuse Going Out of Tetuan.</p>

<p>Walking into the feddan in search of information
about her, every Moor or Jew only replied with shrugged
shoulders and extended palms. Who could tell? She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
might come in at eleven, she might not. "Ift shallah"
(Allah will show). As she had two hundred and forty
tons of cargo to unload, the agents thought she might
stay till the following day before starting for Gibraltar:
on the other hand, the previous night had been a rough
one, and it was quite possible she had passed Martine
altogether, and did not intend to call for another fortnight.</p>

<p>It was a sunny morning: there was nothing to be said
but "Mektub" (It is written), and nothing to be done
except sit in the sun and await events, after the fashion
of the brown figures in jellabs also sitting in the sun
against the south wall of the feddan where it is highest
and nearly always dusty.</p>

<p>Wandering up and down, Spaniards were to be seen
in one caf&eacute; shuffling filthy cards and drinking spirits,
while in another, behind a great vine which held in its
arms a rustic trellis porch and seats, Moors lay on their
elbows, tumblers of tea swimming in mint in front of
them and long kif-pipes. A Riffi sat on a stool in the
sun, leaning against the vine, nursing his gun; his single
long black lock fell down by his ear, glossy and tied in
a knot at the end. Next door a gunsmith was at work
in his little shop sand-papering a gun-stock: a sheep
was penned inside against the Great Feast, and more
sheep in the grocer's beyond. On the opposite side of
the great square a Jew was selling enamel ware to one
of the five lady missionaries. Then meat came hurrying
by, just killed outside the Mulberry Gate and still warm.
Red-and-white shapeless carcases were balanced on a
donkey's back, kept steady by a sanguinary Moor who
sloped along behind: the donkey knew its own way well,
across the wide feddan, down a narrow street, and into
the meat market. Thither hurried the lady missionary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
to buy a joint. If cooked before it has time to get cold
the meat is tender, otherwise it must be hung.</p>

<p>It did not seem long before the bell on the top of the
Spanish Consulate rang out twelve o'clock. There was
no sign of any steamer&mdash;the steamships agent had given
her up; and not wishing our luggage to lie on the beach
all night&mdash;for gumption was not one of the characteristics
written on our pock-marked boy's face&mdash;we sent a
messenger off on the two hours and a half ride down
to Martine to summon him back.</p>

<p>About one o'clock, just as we were sitting down to
lunch in Mr. Bewicke's room, the news arrived that the
steamer was signalled. All doubt was at an end: we
lunched complacently, allowed time for coffee and a
button-hole out of the garden, mounted the mules,
Mr. Bewicke his white pony; the gardener, Madunnah,
following behind on foot, carrying our sticks and
umbrellas, which burden was increased half-way through
the city by a bracket, but lately coloured in garish
tones, vermilion prevailing&mdash;it bled somewhat, but was
to serve as a Christmas present at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Over the cobbles, under the Gate of Wisdom, out on
to the sandy track, and along the sea road we rode, the
mules refusing at first to pass some sacks of grain which
lay in the middle of the path waiting to go down to the
beach. There is a gate tax on every loaded animal
which passes under the Gate of Wisdom, to avoid which
the sacks are carried just out of the city on men's backs,
set down, and picked up in time by mules.</p>

<p>The first mile or so was not worse going than usual.
Coming from the right by a trail which led across the
river, a string of women bore towards us, bringing wood
into the city from villages miles away&mdash;scrub off the
mountain-side. Their rough heads were bound round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
with weather-stained coloured handkerchiefs: listless eyes
looked straight out from under lined foreheads. On each
side of their doubled-up backs protruded rough wood-ends&mdash;these
kept in place by a rope over the shoulder, grasped
in knotted hands above copper-coloured muscular arms.
The bit of towelling round the loins, brushed by the
wind, left bare a species of knees and legs, carved by
two thousand years of toil into humanized Norman piers,
buttressed with muscle, in which ankles have no lot
nor part, which have carried and still carry unreasonable
loads from childhood to the grave. These women
walked in single file, as do the mules and donkeys. And
this is partly due to the space which the wide bundles
take up on each side, partly to bad paths, and partly
to entire lack of initiative. Why should they strike out
a line of their own, these "cattle" and "beasts of burden,"
as they call themselves? The old way comes easier.</p>

<p>Thus life has moved across Morocco, without deviation,
down immeasurable years, and moves so to-day, along
innumerable trails worn afresh by bare feet after every
rain-storm, footprint into footprint, padded hard and
smooth, narrow and polished.</p>

<p>The flats, after so much wet weather, were under
water, and the lower down the road dropped, the deeper
the country grew. Our mules struggled along at a slow
walk, and we constantly diverged off the track, circling
to this side or the other whenever a field looked
an improvement upon our muddy quagmire, generally
to find that it was very little better and sometimes
worse.</p>

<p>About half-way we met our luggage and messenger.
The pock-marked boy had taken our effects to the shore,
had found no steamer, waited a short time, then calculated
that he would be late getting back to the city, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
ran risks of robbers, to say nothing of <i>ginns</i> (spirits)
lurking in the wells by the road, so turned his face
homewards.</p>

<p>We were in total ignorance, and so of course was he,
all this time as to the movements of the steamer: once
out of the city, the level of the road is such that nothing
can be seen of the sea until a couple of hours' riding,
lands people right on the beach itself. With every hope
that she still lay at anchor, we turned our "pock-mark"
round, and the poor mule faced the bad road down to
Martine for the second time that day.</p>

<p>Madunnah handed over the bracket to crown our
baggage, and plodded bravely on, often well up to his
bare knees in mud and water. A brace of duck forged
across the sky above our heads; some plover called and
called again mournfully, wheeling above the irresponsive
marshes and brown fallows; a string of mules moved
like mites over a cheese in the sandy distance. We
passed the Wad-el-Martine in heavy flood, its yellow
yeasty depths swirling between the soft red banks.</p>

<p>At last a couple of stone bridges came into sight,
isolated in a waste of water, remnants of the old
Portuguese road, and in normal times affording a dry
path over two dykes. We plunged through unseen holes
and among stony pitfalls up to the lonely landmarks
and dry ground for a few yards; then more floods; but
after that the last mile or two became easy enough, the
land rose, and dry sandy dunes, with tough bents flattened
in the wind, conduced towards a jog, almost a canter.
Goats, picking up a bare living, scattered as we hurried
along, past the white Customs House and an old wharf
on the river, away to the beach. Behind us the mountains
were black and purple, heavy rain-clouds were
gathering, and directly we topped the crest of the sandy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
shore a strong east wind met us full in the teeth straight
off the sea. But there as large as life lay the steamer,
a long way out, on account of the bar and the wind,
with a choppy sea running between.</p>

<p>A cargo-boat was vainly trying to cross the bar, towed
by a long green boat which six Moors were rowing.
She made no headway, shipped water which deluged
the cargo, and seemed half aground on the bar. No
other boat or boatmen seemed to be available: the
steamer was not within hail. Certainly there were three
more cargo-boats lying in shelter in a corner of the
river-estuary a little way off the land, but some men
in one of them seemed half asleep&mdash;at any rate, they
were out of our reach, and deaf to our shouts and
gesticulations to the effect that we wanted to be rowed
on board the steamer.</p>

<p>We waited and waited; Madunnah yelled himself hoarse;
but the cargo-boat still rolled on the bar, lashed by the
waves, and the men still strained at their oars and paid
no heed to our cries. Twice we thought they meant
coming to our signals, but each time they were only
trying fresh man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p>Rain came on, a sharp easterly scud; the pock-marked
boy drew his jellab over his head; the mules turned their
backs to the squall; but Madunnah still stood at the
edge of the waves, gesticulating wildly with our sticks
and umbrellas at the impassive rowers. Sunset was
upon us. At a fire of driftwood on the beach a short
distance off R. and I tried to warm ourselves.</p>

<p>Suddenly the long green boat left the cargo and pulled
towards us: the sea was rising, and looked anything but
encouraging; breakers were showing their white teeth
on the bar; but the green boat drew nearer and came in
at last, or nearly so&mdash;for she stopped short off the shore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
and, half aground, lost her rudder. Still none of the crew
paid the faintest attention as we hailed them in Arabic,
English, and Spanish across the few yards of water which
put them just out of our reach. They had something
else to do except attend to three mad Britishers&mdash;let
them rave.</p>

<p>The cargo-boat, deserted by the long green boat, had
stuck worse than ever: darkness was coming on, and she
was in a bad case. The men in the "long green"
roused the half-sleeping Moors in the companion boat,
and it was evident that both meant going out together
to tow the belated cargo in.</p>

<p>Our voices carried less as the wind rose, and it was
evident even to Madunnah that words were wasted. The
rain drove in torrents; it was bitterly cold, and growing
darker every moment; as the two boats turned their heads
towards the wave-swept cargo we realized that it was
night, that all chance of getting on board was at an
end for that day at least, and we set our backs to
the sea.</p>

<p>There still remained one alternative and a last chance
of getting to Gibraltar for Christmas Day: the steamer
might not leave till the following morning, and, taking
shelter for the night in the Customs House on the beach,
we ought to be able to get on board at daybreak. We
turned off to the left through blinding gushes of rain,
and headed for this refuge.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-19.png"><img src="./images/ill-19_th.png" alt="A MOORISH PRISON GATE." title="A MOORISH PRISON GATE." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">A Moorish Prison Gate.</p>

<p>The Customs House was much like a caravanserai:
an open space in the middle was enclosed by sheds for
mules and asses; a rough stair led to the living-rooms,
above the sheds, which opened on to a flat white roof.
We stumbled up on to the roof; then in under a low doorway
into a little wooden lean-to, where an old Jew caretaker
was living. The rest of the place was given over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
to a family of Israelites, who had come down to "the
seaside" from Tetuan for change of air.</p>

<p>Much to our relief, the old Jew caretaker assured us that
the steamer would be landing cargo till noon on the following
day: he offered us everything he had in his power for
that night, and promised to see us off in a boat the next
day. Committing us to his care, Mr. Bewicke left us and
rode back to Tetuan with the mules and Madunnah; our
baggage was stowed away under shelter; and the old Jew,
finding a light and improvising two seats out of boxes
and matting, sat us down at his little table, with a bit
of frayed linoleum on it and a glass.</p>

<p>The roof leaked and the rain beat on to the linoleum,
but we were in snug quarters after the beach, and our
friendly host began boiling up a great black kettle in
a tiny inner room, assisted by a Moor. He was very
rheumatic, the old man, also very deaf, and Martine
must have been a damp spot for him (the river and marshes
close at hand, and east or west wind, both of them heavy
with moisture&mdash;nothing would dry, hung out in the air at
Tetuan); nor were his quarters rain-proof.</p>

<p>He hobbled backwards and forwards, muffled up in a
worn grey handkerchief, with a fortnight's white stubble
on his chin, and an aged greenish overcoat down to his
slippers.</p>

<p>From the recesses of a bunk in the next shelter, where
he slept, he produced some pink china cups; then returned
with a plate of bread, hardened to the consistency of
biscuit, and smelling strongly of aniseed. After that he
made tea in a little brown earthenware teapot&mdash;sweet green
tea with mint&mdash;and we soon thawed under a succession of
cups. Still he stumbled about, hunting out of a cupboard
a small basket of eggs, and in the next room a great
stirring and beating-up followed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
By-and-by the Moor who had been assisting him
appeared with an omelette; it was dark brown, mixed
thick with aniseed, chopped ham, and parsley; nor was
it easy to dispose of it.</p>

<p>Our kind host ended up by pressing gin on us.</p>

<p>Warmed and fed, but unfortunately unable to sustain
a conversation with him either in Arabic or Spanish, and
having exhausted the few words at our command, the next
best thing was to make ourselves comfortable for the night.
Lighting a candle, the old Jew paddled across the wet
roof, and we followed him, dimly distinguishing beasts
feeding in the stalls down below, to a small room on the
far side, where some sort of preparation had been made
for us: a rug was spread on the stone floor, and a bedstead
had a blanket laid upon it, while our baggage was piled
in a corner. Putting on overcoats and rugs, we sat down
on one of our trunks&mdash;it is unwise to place confidence
in unknown beds in Morocco; but when, driven by sheer
weariness, we lay down as we were on the blanket, we
slept unmolested.</p>

<p>A Jew on the other side of a thin partition which did
not reach the ceiling, snored heavily and awoke us at
intervals. About six next morning, what sounded very
like the steamer's whistle blew repeatedly, but we paid
little attention to it, the old Jew and Mr. Bewicke having
both assured us the boat would leave about twelve o'clock.
Morning had dawned when we burst open the wooden
shutters of a little window much swelled with damp, and
looked out across the sand-dunes at the sea.</p>

<p>There lay the black hull of the steamer at anchor: the
wind of the night before had dropped; a flaring sunrise
and stormy sky lowered behind the Riff Mountains, which
were black.</p>

<p>Dressing was short work. The Moor handed us in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>
at the door a tin basin of water, and in a short time
we were ready for the next move. At that point R.
craned up to look out of the high window. When she
spoke, I could hardly believe her words. . . . <i>The steamer
had weighed anchor and was moving.</i></p>

<p>There was no mistaking it: the black hull had swung
round, and was making for the open sea, with a flag
of smoke trailing behind her; and away she went to
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>We rushed out upon the flat roof and up a rotten
ladder minus three rungs&mdash;all unheeding&mdash;which gave
access to the roof above our room, gaining nothing thereby
except a panoramic view, with the departing boat in
the middle distance. Already she stood well out to
sea: the Customs House was a quarter of a mile from
the beach: there was nothing to be done: to blame our
kind old host would have been as ungrateful as it was
useless, and regrets were equally unavailing. True it
is that the wise man fends for himself and makes no
arrangements second-hand in Morocco, where every one
is <i>casual</i> and every plan is <i>casual</i>. Had we found out
when the ship's papers were going on board, and arranged
with the agent to call us and take us in his boat, we
should have eaten plum pudding in Gibraltar. Apparently
the steamer had been signalling for the last hour to
the effect that she was going, that the weather was bad
and the sea rough outside, and that she would not venture
to stay and dispatch her cargo&mdash;none of which facts
the deaf and decrepit old Jew had grasped. He hobbled
out, and would hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>We sat down to some weak green tea and the same
dry aniseed-flavoured bread as the night before, and, thus
fortified, reviewed our course of action, which had few complications,
there being no other steamer before Christmas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>
and the ride to Ceuta or Tangier barred by reason
of the flooded streams and general state of the country.
The "open road" pointed towards Tetuan and our old
quarters in the Spanish fonda, of which we had taken
only the day before such joyful leave. It was inevitable,
that next move; and should be made quickly, to judge
by the look of the weather&mdash;the clouds were growing
lower and blacker every half-hour.</p>

<p>Animals were a difficulty&mdash;our mules had gone back
to the city the night before; but it would have been
hard work wading across the flooded acres for seven
miles; and there was our luggage.</p>

<p>Eventually we raised a seedy little rat of a pony, which
R. rode; a ragged donkey, on which half our goods
was balanced; while the other half went on a mule, with
me on the top of all. We turned our backs on the
hospitable white Customs House and the ill-favoured sea
with a muttered imprecation.</p>

<p>In Tetuan a wealthy man was building a house. It
was at a standstill for want of plaster. The plaster
had already come in on the steamer <i>three</i> times, and
three times she had gone away without unloading it.
The boat we had lost had made a fourth endeavour, and
we learnt afterwards that Mr. N&mdash;&mdash;'s ill-fated plaster
had formed the cargo in the wave-washed boat of the
evening before. Wet through, it set as hard as a stone
in the sacks, and was useless: it lay like rocks on the
beach. The bar at Martine has been tolerated for unknown
ages: there is no reason to think that the Moor
will rouse himself into making an effort and trying to
facilitate the landing of passengers and cargo.</p>

<p>We left upon our right as we rode along, some
hundreds of yards from the sea, the remains of what
years upon years ago was a fort, built somewhat as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
forts will be built in the near future&mdash;with a view to
concealment. The outside wall facing the Mediterranean
was crescent-shaped, and but four feet high at most, the
sand sloping up nearly to the top, and overgrown with
vegetation, so that little or no fort showed at all. There
were a few loop-holes, through which men could shoot
from the inside lying down; there was a well in the
centre of the fort, and a small bomb-proof building, with
an arched roof many feet thick, where powder had been
kept. A primitive construction, this harmless-looking
little crescent facing the sea&mdash;once upon a time bristling
with dare-devil Moors and their long guns.</p>

<p>Half-way to Tetuan we passed <i>the</i> cart, the first and
last I saw in the place: its antediluvian body was set
on two demented wheels, which rolled out of the upright
like a tipsy sailor. The cart was Government property:
five mules of different sizes, drew it up in a string from
the sea to the city, through the quagmire, laden with
flour and kerosene oil and stores of all descriptions,
a couple of Moors toiling alongside.</p>

<p>R.'s "rat" was not too surefooted, and some of the
floods were deep: once it came on its nose, but a second
time sat down in a hole in the middle of a sheet of
water, leaving nothing for its rider but to slip off and
wade out, walking afterwards wherever the track allowed,
to raise a little circulation underneath drenched clothes.
A certain melancholy possessed the flats as well as our
vexed selves that stormy and ill-fortuned morning. In
places the tops of the grass-blades alone showed in a
green watery waste, except where tall dark rushes made
a heavier mass, or where the tufts of red-brown tangle lay
in warm lines. The sea behind us was an angry purple; the
Riff Mountains were steel-blue; the nearer hills now black,
now gold in fitful sun-gleams, now crossed by a rainbow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
Only in the north there was a great break, and a light
like brass, behind Ape's Hill. Tradition has it that a
subterranean passage leads thence underneath the Straits
to the Rock of Gibraltar, and is used by the monkeys as
a means of transit from Africa to Europe.</p>

<p>Our miserable beasts were several hours toiling up to
Tetuan: the rain came on, and with the wind straight
off the snows it was as cold a ride as I remember.</p>

<p>The next morning we went to the French Steamship
Company's office for the purpose of recovering our passage
money from the agent, who had insisted upon our buying
tickets beforehand. This fat, greasy Tangier Jew, of no
chin, and flabby, suet-pudding face, flatly refused in plausible
French to return us our cash, gesticulating, contradicting
himself, pretending to misunderstand us, all in the same
breath, and needing nothing so much as a good kicking.
Since the money would only go into his own pocket,
we fought the point, and, after being most insolent, he
was obliged to promise that if the French Consular
Agent in Tetuan judged it right, he would hand over the
money.</p>

<p>To the French Consular Agent we went: a Moor,
whose office was in the French Post Office&mdash;a solemn,
dignified man in a flowing blue jellab, over the same in
white, both hoods drawn up over his head, showing a
long olive face of the true Arab type, black eyes, black
beard and moustache. He wore white socks and yellow
slippers&mdash;a most courteous individual. On hearing our
case, he simply sent for the Steamships Company Agent,
and told him to hand over the money. We sat and
waited with Mr. Bewicke, who was interpreting for us.
Presently a step, and, much out of breath, the plausible
Jew himself arrived, in a long great coat and billy-cock.
He took a seat, and stated his case in Arabic to the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
Consular Agent. There could have been no greater contrast
than between the vulgar excited Israelite and the
stately Mohammedan. The Moor sat with folded arms:
occasionally he raised one hand to emphasize a quiet
monosyllable. But alas for the steadfastness of his race!
Perhaps he disliked being mixed up in the matter. At
any rate, having said that the money was to be refunded,
he allowed the Jew to argue the point, and, we gathered,
was telling him finally that the whole question had better
be referred to the company itself&mdash;a dim and visionary
Steamships Company on the other side of the Mediterranean:
it augured badly for us.</p>

<p>But at this point R. spoke in French, and reminded
the Jew that he had promised to refund the money if
the French Consul so judged, that the Consul had given
judgment, and that if the Jew still refused he was no
longer a man of his word. Strange to say, this quickened
a dormant conscience underneath all the dishonesty, or
it pricked the Jew's pride; at any rate, after a torrent of
protestations, from his tight waistcoat-pocket he produced
a pile of dollars, and handed them over to us. The money
had taken an hour to draw: as far as actual value went
it was not worth it.</p>

<p>The French Consular Agent, the dignified Moor, had to
all intents and purposes failed us at the critical moment,
since he would not exert his lawful authority over a
French-protected Jew. But a Moor's faults may be
summed up in one word&mdash;<i>weak</i>. As in the above
instance, refusing to face circumstances or to follow one
definite line of action to the end, he invariably acts on
the principle of "going roundabout." In the course of
time evasion has come to appear to him the best line to
pursue, and he has sunk like a stone into a slough of
compromise, a tarn of apathy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>
Such weakness, incompatible with Moorish fanaticism
and courage, is due probably to tyranny.</p>

<p>Living under a tyrannical government and religion, both
of which, welded together, form the one dominant factor
of his life, the Moor is afraid of each, and stands in
dread of the ruin it is in their power to work in his life.
Not only this, but he lives in fear of his countrymen and
their long guns, of his wives and their poisons, of evil
spirits.</p>

<p>Morocco, as has been said, accepted Mohammedanism
of necessity, not from choice, at the hands of the conquering
Arabs, and it is accepted to-day, as the corrupt
Government is accepted, with a shrug of the shoulders
and "What God wills cannot but be." Weakened by
blind submission, and at the same time holding nothing
for which they have fought or wrought&mdash;no truths made
adamant in the furnace of persecution, no Magna Charta
won on the sword-point of patriotism, all of which are
so much tonic and discipline to a nation, breeding grit,
developing backbone&mdash;the Moorish people are paralyzed
by a despotism which allows no originality of thought
and action; they are no longer capable of "running
straight," but, suave and polite to a fault, lack that species
of courage which conduces towards plain-speaking.</p>

<p>After all, who and what are to blame except the people
themselves? One writer curses the religion, another
curses the Government. <i>Cui bono?</i> Climate and the
fertility of soil may have influenced the races called
Moorish, but the Moor himself is alone responsible for
his Government and his religion.</p>

<p>Historians from time to time have had something to
say about these tribes, and tradition boasts a legion tales
respecting them; but the most able writer upon Morocco in
old times was Leo Africanus, a Moor himself, who, when all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>
his countrymen were expelled from Spain in 1492, fled
to Fez.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years later he was captured by Christian
pirates and taken to Rome. He became a Christian, and
he published his great and reliable history about the time
that Henry VIII. was successful in Flanders and Scotland,
when Wolsey obtained a cardinal's hat, and Catherine
of Arragon had not been ousted by Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p>The aborigines of Morocco were without doubt Berbers,
and to-day Berbers occupy four-fifths of the country, in
spite of the invasions of other nations. First on the list
of the invaders came the Ph&oelig;nicians, the earliest civilizing
agency. The Romans followed eighty years after C&aelig;sar
had landed in Britain, and annexed Morocco, Christianizing
its people. Next to invade the country were the Vandals,
who turned out the Romans, remained among the Berbers
for over a hundred years, leaving red hair and blue eyes
behind them. Then six hundred and ninety-eight years
after the birth of Christ the deluge of Mohammedan
conquest burst over Morocco, and hordes of Arabs, burning
with a fanatical missionary spirit, swept over the
land. At the end of eleven years the resistance of the
Berbers was overcome, and they adopted Mohammedanism
as lightly as they had adopted Christianity under the
Roman rule.</p>

<p>About two years afterwards a body of them crossed
over into Spain under the one-eyed chieftain Tarik, and
laid the foundation of the Moorish supremacy in Europe.
Thither this band of pioneer Berbers was followed by
the Arabs: the two races mingled and built up together
an empire in Spain said to surpass all its contemporaries
in learning and refinement. The Spanish named them
indiscriminately <i>Mauros</i>, and <i>Moors</i> they have been ever
since; but the name Moor can be traced back as far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
23 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when Pliny and Strabo speak of the <i>Maurusii</i>
and <i>Mauri</i>.</p>

<p>A reflection of their empire's greatness shone even in
Morocco itself: libraries and universities were founded
in Fez and Morocco City. But at the same time the
benighted country knew no settled peace; it was torn
with civil war between the Arab and Berber tribes, until
the Berbers finally mastered the Arabs, and forced them
to confine themselves to certain districts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Spain the Moorish Empire, which for
seven hundred years had remained firmly established,
keeping alive Greek philosophy, building the Alhambra
and making an indelible impression upon the Spanish
nation, crumbled and fell, or, more properly speaking,
was expelled from Spain after a year of bitter persecution.
Thousands of Moorish refugees flocked back across the
Straits to the land of their progenitors, and settled in
Tetuan, Tangier, and the cities on the coast, buoyed up
with the lingering hope of returning, when fickle Fortune
smiled again, to the glories of their old houses in Granada,
and to that land which had chosen to cast them out.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the government of Morocco soon
fell into their more capable hands: they amalgamated
more or less with the Arabs and Berbers&mdash;their own
kith and kin&mdash;and the country became known to Europe
as Morocco.</p>

<p>In due time a certain Moor, a <i>Shar&#299;f</i>&mdash;that is, a direct
descendant of the Prophet Mohammed&mdash;as head of the
Mohammedan Church, gradually united under himself
Arabs and Berbers alike, and was acknowledged as their
Feudal Lord, Religious Chief, and Sultan. The present
Sultan is of the same holy line: hence his title of
<i>Shar&#299;fian Majesty</i>.</p>

<p>A Berber and an Arab may easily be distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
from each other. Berbers, taken as a whole, have square
frames, high cheek-bones, small eyes, and are great
walkers, not horsemen. The mountains are to them
what the plains are to the Arabs, and they prefer an
agricultural life to any other.</p>

<p>Leo Africanus describes them, and his picture in all
essentials holds good to-day: "They are strong, terrible,
robust men, who fear neither cold nor snow; their dress
a tunic of wool over bare flesh, and above the tunic a
mantle, round their legs twisted thongs, never anything
on the head. They rear sheep, mules, and asses; and
they are the greatest thieves, traitors, and assassins in
the world."</p>

<p>From personal experience let this ryder be added:
that they make good servants, faithful up to a certain
point, to be trusted up to a certain point; but they are
rascals.</p>

<p>In Tetuan many more Berbers are to be met with
than Arabs: the Riff tribe is Berber, and Tetuan is full
of Riffis.</p>

<p>Until the last thirty years the Berbers owned only
a nominal allegiance to the Sultan; to-day he could
pass through little of their territory without an army at
his back, and into the Riff country he has never been
at all.</p>

<p>Among the Berbers there is plenty of throat-cutting
as a legal punishment, and murder on the score of
private vengeance, while Government oppression is rampant.
As for travellers journeying across their country,
only certain "roads" are "open" and safe: a Christian,
with proper precaution, is seldom attacked on the way
to Fez or Morocco City&mdash;a Jew occasionally. Off the
beaten track and anywhere in the Riff country his life
would not be worth a <i>flus</i> (small copper coin).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
The Arabs have given the Berbers a name of their
own&mdash;<i>Shillah</i>, which means "Outcast," referring back
to the days when they drove them out of the plains
up into the mountains; and it has stuck to them ever
since.</p>

<p>Travellers descant upon <i>the noble Shillah race</i>. The
dialect which they speak is called Shillah: the Riffis
at Tetuan spoke Shillah among themselves, but soon
picked up Arabic of a sort, and a little Spanish.</p>

<p>The Arab differs in every respect from the Berber.
One of the finest types among mankind, he has a tall,
spare frame, aquiline nose, fine eyes. He is kind, hospitable,
dignified, abstemious, a poet, a gentleman, and a
horseman. He is capable of great things, and of all
Orientals has most impressed himself upon the world.
At the same time he is too often treacherous and blood-thirsty,
inclined to be sensual and inquisitive.</p>

<p>Perhaps his faults have led to the extolling of the
noble Shillah race at the Arab's expense. On this
subject Mr. Cunninghame Graham writes, that certain
travellers in Morocco must have "been humiliated at
finding in the Arabs a finer type than their own, and
have turned to the Shillah race with the relief that
the earthen teapot must find when taken away from
the drawing-room companionship of Dresden china and
put back again on the kitchen dresser." For myself
"earthen teapot" and "Dresden china" have both much
fascination. I would trust either just as far as I could
see him.</p>

<p>Thus Morocco is populated by two antipathetic races,
who neither singly nor jointly have or can consolidate
it into a thriving empire. The Arab cared only to convert
a conquered people to Mohammedanism and to push his
individual fortune, heedless of assimilating individuals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
into one nation, as did the Romans. Great Arab chiefs
there have been, but never a patriot. With the fatalistic
spirit of the East, and a tendency to see life only from
the personal standpoint, it followed that, when a holy
war no longer fired the wandering and independent
shepherds to fight and forced them to obey, they became
"slack," remained stationary, or retrograded.</p>

<p>The Arab would not advance civilization in Morocco,
nor would the wild and lawless Berber; the Moorish
refugees from Spain had sadly degenerated; to crown
all, civil war led to the destruction of the libraries and
universities in Fez and Morocco City, and education was
no more.</p>

<p>Ignorance begat worse government; decline and poverty
followed one after the other. Corruption among the
rulers spread downwards and ran through the country,
until the whole body politic was unsound, and is so to-day.</p>

<p>Though the name of the Sultan, as Head of the Church,
is held in reverence, yet many of the tribes would resist
to the uttermost any attempt on his part to subdue them
by force of arms, so unsettled is his empire.</p>

<p>He holds himself to be far superior to the Sultan of
Turkey, who is not descended from the Prophet, but who,
on the other hand, is the guardian of the sacred city of
Mecca, and who possesses superior forces.</p>

<p>Second in rank to the Sultan of Morocco follow his
ministers&mdash;the Chief Minister, the Foreign Minister, the
Chief Adviser, the Minister of the Interior, and the
Minister of Finance. Their duties are to carry out
the Sultan's wishes, and, receiving no pay, they look to
enriching themselves at the expense of their respective
billets.</p>

<p>A body of secretaries come after the ministers, who
write and dispatch the Sultan's decrees to distant cities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
where their letters are read aloud in the mosques to the
people by the governors. A special body of messengers
is employed under the secretaries.</p>

<p>Each district and city has its <i>kaid</i> or <i>basha</i> (its
governor), whose duty is to read the Sultan's letter aloud
and carry out his instructions, who oversees the city
market, prices food, detects false weight, deals with robbers
and murderers, and sees that the peace is kept.</p>

<p>As well as basha every city has its <i>kadi</i>, or judge
of civil law, who settles all questions of land, of grants,
divorces, etc.</p>

<p>We visited the Court of Civil Justice at Tetuan, a tiny
room, carpeted with yellow matting, where the white-haired
kadi, attired in white, sat like a magnificent white
rabbit on a large red cushion on the floor, beside him
a table six inches high, with learned-looking books, ink,
parchment, and thin slips of wood for pens.</p>

<p>Below the basha or kaid come <i>sheikhs</i> (village elders),
who may be called gentlemen farmers. They collect
the taxes directly from the country people. A province
is taxed according to what it produces: no one pays the
sum demanded of him, nor at the time it is demanded,
but eventually every householder in the district is judiciously
squeezed to the uttermost farthing, and half of
what he pays goes into the sheikh's pocket.</p>

<p>Morocco conceals its wealth in times of visitations such
as these: money and corn alike are buried in the ground.
Some of the people are imprisoned, some tortured, and
eventually all disgorge, and are left with barely enough
for their every-day wants.</p>

<p>It is a system typical of the East and its slipshod,
rough-and-ready dealings: its great element of simplicity
harks back to a life in tents, where red tape was unknown.</p>

<p>The highest officials are in the habit of transacting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
business at their street doors or in their stables: the
basha invariably sits in some gateway near his house,
hearing and judging matters which two or three
gesticulating claimants explain to him. Private matters
are public property: the man in the street chats with
the Minister of Finance&mdash;for are not all men equal?
The minister may have sold groceries at one time, before
he was called upon to fill a position at Court. Who can
tell what a day may not bring forth?</p>

<p>The Sultan&mdash;who is known as "The Lofty Portal,
the Exalted of God, the Noble Presence"&mdash;has a body
of servants and retainers round him: first of all "The
Learned Ones," men who advise him, but make a point
of ascertaining his wishes before they give an opinion,
and are of no use at all except in conducting negotiations;
next the officer who carries the great pearl-and-gold-embroidered
parasol over his head; next an officer
who flicks away flies; then a master of ceremonies, a
headsman, a flogger, a shooter, a water-bearer, a tent-layer,
a tea-maker, a standard-bearer, and a "taster"
to see that no poison is given.</p>

<p>More closely connected than any of these with the
Sultan is of course his harem, of both black and
white women, who have been honoured by admission
into the much-sought-after precincts. Some of them
are Circassians, supplied by Constantinople: all are
the best which money can buy, or ease and position
tempt. When their numbers have been greatly swelled,
certain of them are drafted on as presents to kaids
and bashas.</p>

<p>The offspring of the Sultan's numerous wives are
brought up in isolated sanctuaries, each boy in company
with a slave of his own age, whom he calls brother.
Girls inherit no rank.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
One and all are married when they reach maturity,
at a State function which takes place each year, the
Sultan choosing their consorts. He gives his favourite
son&mdash;whom he has named as his successor&mdash;a high
command in the army or an important governorship:
as long as the boy is too young for either, the Sultan
associates him with himself in official receptions.</p>

<p>All possible rivals to the Sultan are disposed of,
chiefly by banishment.</p>

<p>Guarding the intriguing and inflammable harem are
eunuchs, imported at great expense from Abyssinia,
and responsible for the Sultan's wives and concubines,
whom "wise women" prepare to meet their lord. The
late Sultan was in the habit of having his harem
paraded in his garden on Thursdays, in order to select
the most attractive, and spend Friday&mdash;the Mohammedan
Sunday&mdash;in her company.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the Imperial Treasure, which
is distributed between Fez, Morocco City, and Mequinez,
of which no details are ever made public, can only
be opened by agreement between the keeper, the
governor of the palace, the trusted eunuch, and the
head woman in charge of the harem. The secrets of
its treasures are jealously guarded. It is probably
impoverished.</p>

<p>Every one who approaches the Court is expected to
make the Sultan a present, and his collection of offerings
would stock a museum.</p>

<p>In the time of George I. we read of the Sultan's being
sent "a rich crimson velvet sedan or chair for the favourite
Sultana, and ten pounds of the finest tea at thirty shillings
a pound." In the present day telephones, heliographs,
gramophones, bicycles, motor-cars, guns, fireworks, and the
latest inventions of all kinds find their way into Morocco.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
In return the staple Moorish offering has always been,
and still is, Arab horses, with richly embroidered saddles
and bridles.</p>

<p>It is impossible to estimate the strength of the Moorish
army. The only regulars are under European instruction,
Sir Harry Maclean (known as Kaid Maclean) acting as
commander-in-chief. Their pay is something like a penny
half-penny a day for infantry, fourpence for cavalry, a
shilling for commanding offices. The ranks consist of
private, sergeant, captain, centurion, and colonel, each
officer having a lieutenant.</p>

<p>Every Moor capable of bearing arms in Morocco is
liable to be <i>pressed</i> for service.</p>

<p>In May, when the country is dry, each basha or kaid
is ordered to collect troops in his own district: then is
Tetuan deserted, and every boy and young man absents
himself. How the lady missionaries hid their house-boy!
Tetuan sent off two hundred men, under a colonel, while
we were there, which were to help punish certain rebellious
tribes. Often these expeditions are for the purpose of
raising taxes. In any case the tribes against which the
Sultan's troops are sent are said to be "eaten up." Long
before it happened it was known and talked of.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; the Beni M`Saira would be eaten up in
April."</p>

<p>The Tetuan two hundred were sent to help eat up the
Beni M`Saira tribe, some of whom had abducted two
Spanish children a year ago. The children had driven
their pigs on to land belonging to the tribe&mdash;a thing
abhorred of by Mohammedans, to whom pigs are unclean.
Expostulation was not heeded, and the Beni M`Saira
resorted to strong measures, and kidnapped the children.
They were sold from family to family beyond hope of
recovery, and it would be hard to say what was their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>
fate. Of course they were never seen again. Tales were
circulated which said that the girl had been turned into
a dancing-girl, and taught to dance upon hot ashes, or
she may have become slave and concubine to some Moor.
She was sixteen years old, and the lady missionaries at
Tetuan knew her well, and her ten-year-old brother.</p>

<p>The Spanish Government had complained to the
Sultan, and now a year after the offence the Beni
M`Saira were to be eaten up; there was to be a general
raid upon their country: men would be killed, women
taken as slaves, villages burnt, and corn destroyed. The
worst part of the whole business is the fate of the
prisoners on these occasions. These unfortunate men,
suffering scarcely for their own misdeeds, are sent in
chains to far-distant city prisons, whence they seldom
emerge alive.</p>

<p>The colonel of the Tetuan contingent was an example
of the rapid rises and the vicissitudes of life in Morocco.
Only the other day he had been harbour-master down
at Martine, but was accused of smuggling and turned
out of that berth; he then took a caf&eacute; and sold drinks
in Tetuan, when suddenly the Sultan's pleasure took
the shape of making him a full-blown colonel in his
troops. As in the days of Joseph, the chief butler is
sent for out of prison and made much of: the baker
is sent for and hanged.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-21.png"><img src="./images/ill-21_th.png" alt="A SAINT-HOUSE, TETUAN." title="A SAINT-HOUSE, TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">A Saint-House, Tetuan.</p>

<p>The lucky colonel and his two hundred left Tetuan
in bad weather: their pay was such that many of them,
before starting, sold the bullets supplied them, in order
to buy food with the money, preferring to fight without
ammunition rather than on empty stomachs; but only
<i>one quarter</i> of them got as far as El K`sar&mdash;the rest
deserted on the road, to escape hunger and exhaustion
from rain and cold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
The Oolad Moosa tribe were eaten up not long ago;
their land was harried, their fruit-trees destroyed, and
themselves killed, imprisoned, and enslaved. I was told
by a Spaniard that he had seen five camel-loads of the
heads of tribesmen brought into Larache while he was
there. The Sultan offered three shillings per head. His
soldiers sent up not a few heads which belonged to their
own companions-in-arms. Consignments were sent off to
various cities throughout Morocco, where the Jews, as
usual, salted them, and they were set up over the gates
and on the walls.</p>

<p>There is little or no artillery in his Shar&#299;fian Majesty's
army, though the few cannon he has, render him all-powerful
against his rebellious tribesmen, who are only
armed with rifles (principally French), which are smuggled
into the country.</p>

<p>Soldiers are supplied with the same rifles and European
swords: the native curved dagger is also used.</p>

<p>Pitched battles are seldom heard of. The troops entrench
themselves strongly, gallop out in parties against
the foe, fire a volley into his line, and gallop back again
to reload. Pillage is the great element in this species
of guerilla warfare.</p>

<p>In connection with the army are the <i>Makhaznia</i>
(mounted police): they are practically cavalry. A few
were quartered in Tetuan, and the basha employed them
to take men prisoners and preserve peace and take
messages and so on. The Makhaznia are paid for whatever
they do by any one who employs them, and they
often act as soldier-escort to Europeans.</p>

<p>The Government of Morocco has but one hinge&mdash;a
golden one. Thirty thousand pounds was paid by the
late governor of Morocco City for his billet, and a capable
man would still make his fortune before he retired, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
means of bribes and presents from every one in connection
with him, and a little undue pressure and taxation here
and there. But no governor is exempt from that war-cry
in Morocco, "Pay! pay! pay!" And if he or
a basha wish for the Sultan's favour, which in order
to remain in office is most desirable, he will forward a
present regularly to Court, though at every feast he is
obliged to send another in addition. When a Sultan
imprisons a minister, he confiscates all his money.</p>

<p>Bribes largely contribute towards filling the coffers of
Government officials, from toadies down to unfortunate
sufferers. A man has to buy himself out of prison: it
costs a murderer about four pounds. Those who cannot
afford to pay do not come out.</p>

<p>Not long ago a poor man whom we knew was suddenly
appointed to fill a lucrative post under Government. He
dare not refuse it, but he was head over ears in debt,
and of course a large sum of money was due in return
for the appointment. He borrowed from the Jews and
took up office. In one year he had paid all his debts,
he had paid the Jews, and built himself a luxurious
house. And who can wonder at it? Customs-house
officers can all retire after <i>three years</i> (if they choose),
and live well. It is calculated that the Government gets
exactly half of the duties.</p>

<p>Tetuan had a favourite tale of bribery. A man wanted
to make sure of a case he was bringing before the basha.
He knew that the basha had a weakness for mirrors.
He was a poor man, but he bought the best looking-glass
he could afford, and dispatched it. The case came on;
the basha gave it against him.</p>

<p>"What!" cried the poor, discomfited loser; "did you
not receive the mirror?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the basha coolly; "but immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
afterwards a very fine mule came along, and <i>he kicked
the looking-glass into a thousand fragments</i>."</p>

<p>So when a man is disappointed of his due, they say,
"The mule has kicked the glass."</p>

<p>Another man had a brother in prison whom he wished
to buy out: he took the basha a mule, and presented
himself with his present.</p>

<p>"You shall not bribe me," said the basha. "Soldier!
put this man into prison with his brother, and put the
mule into my stable."</p>

<p>The man's family had a heavy bribe to raise.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Ah! Moon of my delight, who know'st no wane</p>
<p>The Moon of Heaven is rising once again:</p>
<p>How oft hereafter rising shall she look</p>
<p>Through this same garden after me&mdash;<i>in vain!</i></p>
</div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christmas Day</span> in a Mohammedan city passed
with nothing to mark it except deluges of rain.
The fonda had not grown upon us; and when two
Moorish houses in the city at last presented themselves,
the result of weeks of inquiry, we decided to take one, if,
as was apparently the case, a garden-house outside the
city was not to be had for love or money. The Moors
all told us it was impossible. The fact is, that they are
chary of letting their houses to unbelievers: the thing
is not encouraged in the land; indeed, they are liable to
be imprisoned for doing so, unless they have "protection"
from a foreigner.</p>

<p>All sorts of complications have arisen out of permission
granted to Europeans to settle in the country: it depends
on the European; he does something foolish, and legal
or social or religious difficulties arise, and a storm in a
teacup may end in serious dispute and a heavy indemnity
to pay. So, naturally enough, the Sultan's advisers
are averse to extending the limits of property owned
by Europeans, and the barriers which they put in the
way, debar ordinary people from running up villas and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
committing outrages such as half the world endures in
silence.</p>

<p>In Morocco it is necessary first of all to obtain the consent
of the Government for the purchase of land. Interest
can sometimes do it, and the pill must be heavily gilt.
The next obstacle lies with Moorish jurisdiction, which,
with forethought, sets forth that all disputes relating to
property shall be referred to native courts and settled
by Moorish law. This opens a door to barefaced bribery
and intimidation: some one will be fleeced. Last of all,
Moorish workmen building for an Englishman or any
foreigner are liable to persecution and arrest. Thus foreign
labour must be employed. And how is foreign labour to
be had? A Jew or Spaniard may not be available. It
is scarcely less difficult to rent a house in Morocco, unless
it is in Tangier.</p>

<p>Of the two which were thus unexpectedly offered us
one was out of the question&mdash;it was damp; but the other,
standing empty in a long narrow alley in the middle
of the city, was as sound as houses built of rubbish and
thin bricks can be, and we went to look over it, well
prepared to ignore petty defects.</p>

<p>It was entered, as usual, by a wide yellow door, studded
with giant nails and a resounding knocker: a courtyard
house&mdash;a most quaint and original construction in which
to spend two or three months. From the ochre-coloured
door we walked into a tiny tiled patio open to the sky,
too small and insignificant for a fountain or an orange-tree: the
kitchen and one other room where servants
could sleep opened out of it, lighted only by their wide
doors, which were never shut. So much for the ground
floor.</p>

<p>A tiny tiled staircase led to the first floor. Four narrow
rooms, windowless, flanked the four sides of the square,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
and looked down into the little court below. Each room
had double doors standing open for light and air. From
the house-top above the first floor, on to which we went
last, there was at least a view of a thousand flat white
roofs, of pencil-shaped minarets, of turtle-backed mosques;
but at the same time the sun itself could not be more
dazzling to look at than was the impossible whitewash
which besmeared all the roofs, and we soon left for our
first floor, in whose four little dark rooms we proposed to
live. Standing on the gallery which ran outside them,
and leaning on the balustrade looking down into the
minute patio, it was a case of the view below into that,
and the view above up at the sky, and no more&mdash;a
limited, and on wet days gloomy, prospect. Added to
that, the orgies worked in the kitchen by a Moorish cook
could not do other than proclaim themselves all over the
first floor. True, the little patio embodied the Moorish
conception of <i>al-fresco</i> seclusion, and a depth of shadow
lay in the inner rooms within the thin shell of the white
walls. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;the lines of old-fashioned
Eliza Cook returned insistently, and refused to be
silenced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Double the labour of my task,</p>
<p>Lessen my poor and scanty fare,</p>
<p>But give, oh! give me what I ask&mdash;</p>
<p>The sunlight and the mountain air.</p>
</div></div>

<p>And in the end the vote was given against the little
windowless dwelling in the Moorish Quarter. No doubt a
courtyard house is bizarre, but it has its imperfections.</p>

<p>A Scotch proverb has it that "Where twa are seeking,
they are sure to find." In time we found. A certain
Moor of Tetuan, named Ali Slowee, a Spanish protected
subject, was guardian, uncle, and stepfather to a boy
named Dolero. Dolero owned a garden-house outside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
the city, called <i>Jinan Dolero</i> (The Garden of Dolero). Ali
Slowee heard of our wants and offered us his nephew's
house, provided we undertook to give it up at the end
of March. Than the unexpected, when it does come,
nothing is so good. After a little difference over the
rent (our landlord began by asking two pounds five
a month, and came down to thirty shillings) all was
settled, and New Year's Day, 1902, found us living in a
whitewashed garden-house in Morocco, out in the country.</p>

<p>Moors have extravagant ideas of the sums English
people will pay. Mr. Bewicke was offered a house and
garden for seven pounds ten a month: some time after
the landlord asked three pounds; eventually he came
down to thirty-nine shillings.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-22.png"><img src="./images/ill-22_th.png" alt="JINAN DOLERO." title="JINAN DOLERO." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Jinan Dolero.</p>

<p>Having handed a month's rent over to Ali Slowee,
he had Jinan Dolero done up, whitewashed at least,
outside and in, from top to toe&mdash;a rite performed on
every opportunity all the year round in Morocco, like
spring-cleanings at home. Tiles were mended, windows
repainted, glass put in, and we followed,&mdash;the simplest
thing in the world; "furnishing" takes no time in Morocco.
Three mules carried out all we put into the empty little
house&mdash;all our effects, that is to say, from the fonda. A
few rugs were unrolled, camp-beds, table, and chairs
put together, some nails driven into the walls, and in
one hour we were "in." Gibraltar supplied the camp
furniture; necessaries were raked together in Tetuan,
including the dome-shaped pewter teapot, and the painted
tins, pink and green and blue, for tea, coffee, and sugar,
which mark the tramp of the European across Morocco,
and are both of them for ever associated with sweet
green tea and turbans. Mattresses we had made, and
made ourselves, of moss, brought in by the countrywomen
and dried; and an Englishman, A&mdash;&mdash; (one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
the few who have become Mohammedans and settled in
Morocco), lent several more, which made divans round
our walls.</p>

<p>A&mdash;&mdash; has a little house close to Jinan Dolero, and
occupies himself with his garden outside the city. He
dresses like a Moor. In spite of it all, he is not
welcomed among them as a brother, but goes by the
name of "The Renegade." They probably divine that
he adopts their religion as a part of the customs of the
country with which he identifies himself, less for the
sake of Mohammedanism itself than for the life which
that religion inculcates.</p>

<p>Apparently men in such a position rarely benefit the
country in which they settle, and often do harm, ending
by paying the penalty of meddling with the manners
and customs of another race.</p>

<p>Now, at the time of writing this chapter, A&mdash;&mdash; has
paid in full. Only a few months after we left Tetuan
he was shot one evening in his garden and killed on
the spot, apparently from close quarters, probably from
behind the hedge. The servants had gone home and
found his body next morning. If they are to be believed,
no one heard a shot. Men have been imprisoned and
men will suffer death for the murder, no doubt; but
whether the actual murderer is shot or goes scot-free,
and what his inducement for committing the crime,
probably half Tetuan will know and half Tetuan will
tell, <i>and tell a lie</i>.</p>

<p>Some say that A&mdash;&mdash; was shot for the sake of his
gun and his money. Others that he was shot by some
Riffi brothers because he was in the habit of talking
to their sister. Others that the murder was connected
with his having lived at one time with a Moorish
woman, from whom he eventually separated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
No one will ever know.</p>

<p>Jinan Dolero would have been called in the Riviera
"a villa": it was a typical Moorish garden-house.
We lived upstairs, after the manner of the country, in
the airiest and lightest of small whitewashed sitting-rooms:
its three windows, set certainly with head-splitting
glass, looked south, east, and west, on sea,
mountains, and city. The second larger room, in which
we slept, had a thick white pillar in the very middle
of it, supporting the ceiling. A store-room on the same
floor did duty as larder, and a staircase led up on to
the flat white roof.</p>

<p>Underneath us were kitchen, mules' stable, and two
rooms for our two servants: a little staircase led down
to them and on to the hall and front door. The floors
were all tiled: a dip in the corner of each room and
a hole in the wall carried off the water when they were
sluiced down. Innocent of spouting, the water merely
streamed down the outside wall. Each window reached
to the floor, and an inartistic iron grille removed all
danger of falling out. It was the sunniest house in
the world, and an airy one, for the passage and rooms
had loop-holes, a foot high and four inches wide, cut
in the wall, through which air freely circulated. On
the ground floor the windows were <i>nil</i>, but more loop-holes
let in ample light. One was constructed on
each side our hall door, that before unbarring at night
we might know what manner of visitor we had, and
even fire a charge through the aperture if the occasion
warranted.</p>

<p>Our garden was another Moorish wilderness, another
"Field of the Slothful," thick in a waste of weeds,
blue borage, and yellow marigolds. But it was also
a vineyard. Dead-looking branches of vines trailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
among the weeds, which later on were cut down with
a sickle and turned into green meat for cows. Splendid
muscats, we were told, our vines would produce: branches
are spread over them in the summer as a slight protection
from the sun, but the grapes are left on the ground
and often soiled; nor has a Moor the slightest idea of
picking them, or of preserving their bloom. Besides
the vines, there were fruit-trees in Jinan Dolero. Pink
almonds blossomed first; the leaf and the flower of
apricots followed; apples, peaches, and pears came almost
at the same time; and we lived in a pink world. The
fig-tree softened its hard heart last of all, and its ashy-grey
arms burst into tender green leaf and infant figs;
at the same time the pomegranates shot into warm red
leaflets. There were lemons which were ripe on the
trees on New Year's Day, and made many a lemon-squash:
there was double narcissus in flower everywhere;
it sprouted up in the grass paths which divided our
garden, and got badly trodden down: there were rows
and rows of beans, which scented the air: last of all,
there were some red geraniums in flower.</p>

<p>A hedge of prickly pear ran down the east side of the
enclosure, a tall cane fence effectually hedged in the
rest, and the whole was entered by the inevitable locked
and barred door, and whitewashed doorway, the long
key of which, was a care in life, till we learnt that in
Morocco every precaution is taken up to a certain point;
matters are then handed over to Providence, and man,
forbearing to meddle further, sits down and awaits their
development.</p>

<p>Thus, with all their locks and bolts, garden doors were
often left open, and the cane fences were full of gaps.
But none of our lemons were stolen&mdash;not, at least, after
we got rid of the guard of soldiers which for the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
week the basha insisted on sending to Jinan Dolero
every night. They ate them.</p>

<p>Fine days were never long enough in the little garden-house
facing the mountains: in the mornings an opal
light; the sunrise stalking across their summits, while
a cloud of white mist would sweep down the valley
out to the blue sea-line; all day bright light and
dazzle, a wind soft and yet racy; at night an abrupt
sunset, leaving for a few moments a rose-pink after-glow,
followed by an intense silence.</p>

<p>The first thing in the morning, we always wandered
in our garden down the grassy paths among the dew;
measured the rain-gauge; looked at the sky; watched
the birds, of which a flight, chiefly flocks of finches,
invariably travelled over the little terraces of fruit-trees
towards the river, taking our garden on the way, and
feeding there for a while. A white jasmine almost hid
our white steps and pillars: a rose grew with lavish
prodigality; as Jinan Dolero stood there, in the middle of
the Garden of the Slothful, a certain imperious dignity
was given to the little white-walled structure by means
of its magnificent situation.</p>

<p>Sometimes we breakfasted in the garden: we were
never in to lunch on fine days, but rode and walked all
over the country, occasionally with the lady missionaries
or Mr. Bewicke, but oftener alone with the big grey
donkey and a boy. There were Moors to see in Tetuan,
and always something of interest: we came away from
that corner of Morocco without having got through half
of what might have been done. To live in a country,
adopting some of its ways and imbibing a little of its
spirit, is the only satisfactory way to "travel." Hotels
with home conventionalities and English tourists never
amount to the same thing. Either camp out or settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
down for a month or two in a hut, with one of the country
people to cook. There must be sport, or agriculture,
or village characters, or architecture, or botany, or
geology to study: bird-life and bird-watching are never-ending
interests; the fields are never empty. Only by
living its own life, can the country and its ways unfold
themselves, and become understood and cared for, by the
traveller who has time for, and a love of, such things.</p>

<p>As a whole, and seen in January before spring has
begun, around Tetuan it is a tired and brownish-looking
country: its colour is bleached and dried out of it, and
it has the air of a sun-dried, wind-blown land, patched
with pieces of brilliant greenery where corn has been
sown near water. And yet it possesses the charm of
strength and repose which simplicity gives; for it has
been worried by man but little, rather allowed to straggle
through the centuries at its own sweet will.</p>

<p>In the evening every Friday, to mark the Mussulman's
Sabbath, the sunset gun boomed and echoed among the
opposite mountains. Watching the grey turreted walls
of the Kasbah bitten out against a primrose sky, with
watch in hand, at last the weekly flash of red, then a
puff of brown smoke shot out of the wall, and last of
all, a reverberating roar, tossed backwards and forwards
among the hills. It is long before the "thunder" dies
away, and we watch a gigantic smoke-ring, sprung from
the mouth of the gun, float lazily out to the south; while
the mueddzin's cry from the top of the mosque rises
and falls on the waves of sound, drifting now clear, now
faint, over the garden.</p>

<p>When the sun dropped, the frogs began, from the
cracks in the moist clay soil where they sat, all
over our acre and a half, croaking in a wet, guttural
chorus&mdash;the whole garden called; and the rattle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
the tree-beetle which followed was one of those tropical
sounds which recall the East. The frogs were tiny
brown fellows, hard to get at. The owls would begin
after the frogs&mdash;a brown owl, which flew noiselessly
in the twilight among the fruit-trees and on to the
edge of the roof, hooting long and low or chuckling
oddly. Then stillness, and wonderful starlight nights,
all through January. That month no rain fell. In
February we had seven and a quarter inches, and more
in March.</p>

<p>Having found Jinan Dolero, and furnished it after a
fashion, we still lacked servants, and they seemed to be
almost as difficult to meet with as houses&mdash;that is,
trustworthy ones. Again, however, we were fortunate.
A soldier-servant who had lived with a missionary
happened to have nothing to do, and agreed to come to
us with his young wife, Tahara. They both of them
knew something of European ways, and were scrupulously
honest. They brought a few oddments, a little
looking-glass, a mattress on which they slept upon the
floor of the room near the kitchen, and a few cooking-pots
and pans of their own. We overcame their objection
to sleeping outside the city at that time of year; but
I believe they never liked it up to the last, though
they comforted themselves with two guns (one of which
belonged to the man, and one he borrowed) and the
fact of a revolver as well, being all under the same roof
with them.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-23.png"><img src="./images/ill-23_th.png" alt="OUR SERVANTS, S`LAM AND TAHARA." title="OUR SERVANTS, S`LAM AND TAHARA." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Our Servants, S`lam and Tahara.</p>

<p>They were both of them Riffis, and their own home
was in the Riff country, two days' journey into the
mountains from Tetuan. His name was S`lam Ben
Haddon Riffi of Bekiona, son of Haddon and of
Fettouch Ben Haddon of Bekiona. S`lam's wife was
Tahara. He had served for a year in the French army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
in Algeria, in the 2nd Regiment of Tirailleurs Alg&eacute;riens;
and having picked up a little French, we learnt, with
a few Arabic words, to understand each other. He and
Tahara spoke Shillah to each other.</p>

<p>S`lam was about twenty-six years old, Tahara about
twenty. He was a sinewy, long-legged ruffian, well over
six feet, and holding himself creditably. He had a pair
of fierce, dark, restless eyes, little beard or moustache, the
front half of his head shaved, and a few locks left long at
the back in token of his being a "brave" and having slain
his man in a blood-feud. The Riffi turban, of strings of
dark red wool, was wound round his head; a white shirt
showed at his neck; he wore a black waistcoat, a white
tunic down to his knees, and red knicks, below which
came his long hairy shanks, ending in a pair of yellow
slippers.</p>

<p>A scarlet leather bag, hung by a red cord over his
shoulders, a leather belt, and his gun, finished off our
Moorish servant, who shot us partridges, roasted chickens,
and was as good a hand at buttered eggs and coffee as
I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Out of doors he always wore his brown jellab, embroidered
with silk tufts of green and yellow and white.</p>

<p>Tahara was a pretty, pale, dark girl, with curious
cabalistic Riffi marks tattooed in blue on her forehead
and chin. She bound round her head an orange-coloured
silk handkerchief; wore, except when at work, an embroidered
yellow waistcoat, a pale blue kaftan down to her
ankles, a sprigged, white muslin, loose garment, all over
that; and a creamy woollen haik, when she went out or
was cold, covered everything.</p>

<p>S`lam acted as butler, Tahara kept our rooms in
order, and they were joint cooks. Their standing dish
was mutton stewed in vegetables, or a chicken; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
given time, four hours in the pot, on the pan of charcoal,
it was quite a success. But they learnt many
things in a Dutch oven lent by the missionaries, besides
stews. They had eccentricities&mdash;as when S`lam prepared
to put the toast-rack itself on the charcoal fire, with the
bread in it, thus to "toast": the toast-rack we made ourselves,
too, out of some old wire. They kept chickens,
which S`lam brought home from market, either in their
bedrooms for the night, or else in the kitchen, until
their crops were empty and they could be killed.</p>

<p>Every morning S`lam was dispatched to the city
with a basket, instructions, and two or three shillings.
He stayed there an unconscionable time, visiting his
mother, and sitting sunning himself in the doorway of
a little Moorish caf&eacute;, returning laden before lunch. He
never went into the city without his gun and best jellab,
striding along with his long legs&mdash;a most picturesque
figure. After dinner every evening he rendered his
account, stalking into the sitting-room when we called,
pulling up a chair, and sitting down at the table opposite
R. From his leather bag, change was produced, and
if the change was wrong, there was agony; but that
only happened once or twice. A scrap of paper was
brought out covered with Arabic writing, items of the day's
expenditure, which read more or less as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='centered'>

<p>Charcoal for cooking purposes, and oil for lamps, added<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
three shillings to our moderate weekly expenditure. Living
is cheap enough in Morocco, nor are servants' wages heavy.
S`lam and Tahara had eighteen shillings a month and
their food, which was simple indeed&mdash;a loaf each of
native bread a day, green tea, lump sugar, and odds and
ends from our meals. Our rent, it will be remembered,
came to thirty shillings a month. Morocco suits "reduced
circumstances."</p>

<p>Once a week, one of the little donkeys, which passed
along our "lane" in droves, carrying charcoal into the
sok, was waylaid, brought into the garden, and its three
pannierfuls commandeered for us and stored in the mules'
stable, where Tahara did the washing in a great tub
bought from Mr. Bewicke.</p>

<p>Milk was left every morning by a Moor, who took it
in for sale to the sok.</p>

<p>When the accounts were all settled up, S`lam would
swing out of the room with a "Bon soir tout-le-monde,"
unless he stayed to give R. a lesson in Arabic, which
he could write as well as read&mdash;an unusual thing, and
marking him for a scholar in his country.</p>

<p>Blood-feuds among the Riff tribe are common enough.
S`lam's father was shot when S`lam was a boy. As soon
as he grew up, S`lam shot the man. He had left the Riff
in consequence: he was a "marked man," they said; but
he began to talk of going back again, and while he was
with us he bought a new French rifle. In the Riff he might
be potted at, he might not: he would risk that. The
brother or son of the man whom he had shot would never
trouble to journey far for the purpose of shooting him.
Why should they? All in good time. Some day, when
he came their way, they would put a bullet into him.
Only women die in their beds in the Riff. "Sudden
death, Good Lord, grant us."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
Men in the Riff who have blood-feuds will not go out
of their houses in the early mornings without first sending
the women and children to look if the coast is clear:
neither will they walk up a hedgerow nor in a wood, but
across the fields, keeping well in the open, since murder
is always committed out of sight, decently, and in good
order.</p>

<p>A man living in Tetuan now, has a blood-feud with
an enemy, who has been in consequence obliged to move
to Tangier. Sometimes he comes over, secretly, by night,
to see his mother, and lies hidden in her house till the
sok is full of market people in the middle of the day,
when he can go out into the crowd without running great
risk,&mdash;though in the sok a quarrel sometimes arises; in
a flash, guns are up at men's shoulders&mdash;bang&mdash;bang&mdash;and
bullets ping into the soft walls, if not into some one or
other. Only lately a boy was shot twice in the thigh,
happening to be in the way in a scuffle.</p>

<p>S`lam and Tahara were often amusing, if not interesting:
never commonplace or "well-meaning." One corner of
the roof of Jinan Dolero had been left unwhitewashed,
the whitewashers' ladder was still there, and one morning
S`lam came to say in his best French, "Deux mesdames.
Pour arranger en haut."</p>

<p>The two madams were the whitewashers&mdash;two black
madams, clad in a couple of striped towels each, Ali
Slowee's slaves, bought for, say, &pound;7 each. A very ragged
countrywoman who came and weeded the garden, and
seemed almost devoid of intelligence, was also a madam.</p>

<p>S`lam was deft with a needle; he borrowed one of ours
and a thimble, sat himself down in the kitchen, and
stitched away at a large white garment "pour Maman,"
he said&mdash;sat up half the night, finished it, and took it to
her next day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
He did not make a bad man-servant; but he was fond
of tempting Fate by carrying trays, laden with china and
glass, balanced on one hand; then he would stoop down
and pick up a kettle in the other, there would be an
ominous clatter, if not crash, in the tray amongst our
crockery, and S`lam would murmur reproachfully under
his breath, "O tray! tray!"</p>

<p>He bought a new jellab for wearing on visits to the
sok; and after it had been proudly shown us, it was
found, neatly folded up, placed on a hat-box in our bedroom.
When we asked why it was there, he was taken
aback. "Mightn't he keep it there? It was new: it
was very clean."</p>

<p>One evening, when he came in to settle accounts, he
said that he wished to write a letter. Would we give him
a sheet of paper and envelope? They were produced.
We were not quite prepared for it, when he at once
drew up a chair, sat down at the table, and politely
asked for a pencil. But it was impossible to snub so
simple and well-meaning a child. I sharpened a pencil,
and S`lam wrote diligently for quite half an hour, without
a pause, from right to left, wonderful spidery characters:
it was a long letter to his old master down in Morocco
City. He held his string-turbaned head on one side,
and was without embarrassment as he sat between R.
and myself (one of us worked, the other wrote); indeed,
S`lam might have spent his evenings in a drawing-room
all his life. When the letter was finished, he accepted
a stamp most gratefully, wished us "Bon soir," and
departed.</p>

<p>Tahara had her eccentricities too, of which one was
an extraordinary aptitude for annexing wherewithal to
tie round her head in place of her own yellow silk scarf,
which was kept for high days. One week one of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
table-napkins was raised to this honour; the next one of
our clean bedroom towels had taken its place round her
dark locks.</p>

<p>I made her a present of a flannel shirt to wear, but
the second day S`lam had appropriated that, and wore
it in place of his waistcoat, unbuttoned.</p>

<p>Apparently, in the eyes of the Tetuan world, we were
taking a most unprecedented and foolhardy step in
sleeping outside the city in the winter: the Ceuta "road"
near us was said to be famous for robbery and murder.
For some reason or other a reputation clung to us of
being fabulously rich. The Moors warned, the missionaries
seriously expostulated with us. None of them
would have done it, and Mr. Bewicke was put down as
mad for countenancing such an action. But we had
two men in the house at night; for, besides S`lam, a
labourer was induced to sleep in the mules' stable for
our protection, and we had a couple of rifles and a
revolver. Now, since the news of the murder of A&mdash;&mdash;,
one wonders . . . . . But <i>he</i> was alone: <i>we</i> had the
safety of numbers.</p>

<p>To show how jealous Moors can be, and what precautions
they take about their women, S`lam never
allowed the labourer inside the garden gate unless he
himself had come in. The man sat and waited on the
bank. Then, after he was installed in the stable, the
door between the kitchen and stable was locked and
bolted. When we went out, Tahara was made to bolt
every door; and if any one came to the house, she would
only call down to them out of our bedroom window.</p>

<p>The first night we slept in our garden-house and for
several nights after, the basha took upon himself to send
us out a guard of soldiers, who were responsible for our
safety. We never asked this favour, and were annoyed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
for they slept under our windows, talked and coughed the
whole night, lay on the bulbs in a flower-bed, and stole
the lemons. Seeing, however, that we did not pay them
anything at all for the attention, the basha soon grew
tired of sending them, much to our relief; for when, to
prevent their depredations, we locked them outside the
garden door, they broke down our fence, scrambled into
the garden, and lay under the prickly pears, as being a
safer place than the lane outside.</p>

<p>There has never such a thing been known, as a guard
without a cough, or who do not talk. If told to be silent,
they reply that they must talk to keep awake; for if
they fell asleep, how could they guard? Occasionally,
to show how much on the alert they are, guards will
discharge their guns in the dead of night. Altogether
Moorish soldiers at close quarters are not conducive to
sleep.</p>

<p>We had an excitement one night, but it turned out
to be groundless. Guns were fired from the garden-house
below ours, repeatedly, about 10 p.m., and S`lam
got into a fever of excitement, brought his rifle up into
our sitting-room, and sat watching at one of the windows.
He thought it was tribesmen come down from the hills
to rob. At last the firing stopped, and R. and I went
to bed; but S`lam was up all night, and Tahara brought
their mattress upstairs and slept in our sitting-room for
safety. It turned out to be Moors who had come out
to sleep for one night, and were amusing themselves by
firing rifles from the loop-holes and out in the garden.</p>

<p>There is an advantage in being in a country where
game is not sacred. For instance, one evening after
tea, standing on the steps outside our "bungalow," in
the hush which came just after sunset, R. and I were
startled by a familiar call over in the garden next ours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
S`lam was strolling about, and confirmed our supposition&mdash;a
partridge. We went indoors and forgot about it; but
ten minutes later the report of a gun brought us out again,
and there was S`lam crashing over the great bamboo fence
into "next door" with his rifle, scudding across our
neighbour's beans, then stooping down over something;
a second later and he was back again, across the
palisade like a lamplighter, and striding triumphantly up
our path with a partridge dangling from his hand&mdash;a
red-legged Frenchman, which we hung long. This
acquisition to the larder had to be applauded perforce, in
spite of its being shot sitting, and on some one else's acres.
As luck would have it, S`lam's great bullet, about the size
commonly used for big game, had gone through its head:
he na&iuml;vely explained the advantages of shooting birds
through the head. But I think he was a fair shot. Most
Riffis are.</p>

<p>I suppose that the Riff tribe is more or less an anomaly.
Think, if you can, of a clan or a tribe who are pirates,
wreckers, who encourage slavery, who count the vendetta
an admirable custom, who have no laws, no governors,
who acknowledge as their supreme head a Sultan who
has never from all ages ventured within their borders&mdash;a
tribe who have, as it has been said, "no fear, no anything,
save and excepting their faith in One God and Mohammed
as his Prophet, their own daggers, a Martini-Henry if
they can get one, and failing that, a ten-foot-long Riff
gun, coral-studded, ivory-butted, brass-bound, and deadly
to handle"&mdash;a people who live in a country without
roads, <i>and all within a few hours of Gibraltar</i>: have they
their parallel, except among adventurers in the Far East,
and those but a few upon distant seas?</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-24.png"><img src="./images/ill-24_th.png" alt="TWO WOMEN FROM THE RIFF COUNTRY." title="TWO WOMEN FROM THE RIFF COUNTRY." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Two Women from the Riff Country.</p>

<p>To explore the unknown Riff country would be interesting
indeed. No book has been written upon it except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
from hearsay, and no European has penetrated across
its length and breadth. The Riffis want no foreign interlopers
among their sacred hills, and would "knife" the
first who showed his face. It is but two days' journey
eastwards from Tetuan, this select and exclusive country,
and it extends about a hundred and fifty miles, with
a population, it is reported, of one hundred and fifty
thousand souls. Strange to think that no European
pioneer, nor gentleman-rover, has ever exploited the Riff.</p>

<p>The law of the vendetta, is the law and the ten
commandments of the Riffi, which, if he fail to keep,
renders him in the eyes of his country-folk damned to
all eternity, to be ostracised among men. A widow
will teach her baby-son to shoot, and studiously prepare
him for his one great duty, that as early as possible
he may put a bullet into the murderer of his father.
And thus the feud is nourished. Even the great-great-grandson
of a man who has taken a life years upon
years ago is not safe. He will probably meet with a
dagger or the muzzle of a long gun one day.</p>

<p>But a people who inculcate such severe and cursory
measures have their redeeming-points. It is a fact that
cursing and swearing, so common among Moors, and
polygamy and adultery, are seldom, if ever, met with in
the Riff: for if one Riffi insults another, it is at the
peril of his life; while the stain of immorality is wiped
out at once by death.</p>

<p>The gun, pistol, or dagger is the Riffi's summary
judge and jury. He submits to no authority. Questions
on land, on inheritance, all legal questions, are settled
in each village by the keeper of the mosque. He arranges
marriages.</p>

<p>The Riffis are therefore a moral people: a man has
but one wife; the women do not veil, and yet familiarity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
is not tolerated between the sexes; a young man will
go out of his way to avoid passing close by a young
woman whom he sees in the distance, lest he be suspected
of behaving lightly to her.</p>

<p>The Riffis are an indomitable race, one which has
never been conquered, magnificent raw material out of
which to shape a battalion of infantry. Though acknowledged
as the Kaliph of the Prophet and their religious
head, the Sultan, as has been said, has never dared to
put his head in this independent hornets' nest.</p>

<p>They are an industrious tribe, growing crops assiduously
and rearing cattle: their valleys are fertile and well
farmed for an uncivilized country. But these details
must be taken for what they are worth. S`lam could
say nothing but good of the Riff: how cheap living
was, and how abundant food,&mdash;except when rain failed,
and then there followed disastrous famine, and starving
Riffis would come down to Tetuan, and lie in the caves
outside the city, and live on roots, doing any work which
offered; and some of them would die, in spite of the
missionaries' kindness and unremitting efforts.</p>

<p>There are many legends about the Riffis: they boast
one tribe among themselves who are said to be descended
from the Romans; and there is no reason against the
assumption, since the Romans were in Morocco after
C&aelig;sar's day. Another family claims to be descended from
the inhabitants of Sodom. Some of them are quite fair&mdash;regular
"carrots": Vandal blood may run in their veins.
While, again, some people say there are Celts among
them, with Irish characteristics and Irish words. Possibly.
Pirates and rovers are apt to introduce foreign strains.</p>

<p>At any rate they have nothing in common with the
Arabs, but are as unlike that race as a Scotchman is
unlike an Italian. Berber is of course their common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
origin, and they are identical with the Kabyles of Algeria,
the Touariks of the Sahara, and the Guanches of the
Canary Isles. Shillah, the Berber dialect which they
speak&mdash;one of the many dialects belonging to that race&mdash;is
not a written language; but an educated Riffi learns
to write and read at his village <i>jama</i> (mosque school);
he uses the Arabic character in writing, and he learns
to read the Kor&#257;n.</p>

<p>Yet in one great point, like the Arabs, the Riffi, in
common with the Berber race, lacks the power of cohesion
and the spirit of patriotism, which should have welded
all Berbers into one powerful people. Internal strife, that
curse of Africa, has split them up into isolated units, and
they stand at the same point they stood at a thousand
years ago.</p>

<p>Nor have the Riffis, in common with the Moors,
reached the point of discarding "petticoats and drapery"&mdash;that
is to say, they wear the brown, hooded, woollen jellab,
and the white woollen haik&mdash;a sheet of material without
seam, which they cast round themselves something
like a Roman toga. Perhaps a cotton tunic is worn
underneath.</p>

<p>Part of the sleeves, the hood, and front of the jellab are
often beautifully embroidered in coloured silks. On the
border of the cloth thin leaves of dried grass are laid,
which are worked over and over with coloured silk, and
make a thick, handsome edging. The coloured leather
belts which they wear; the large embroidered leather
pouches, with deep-cut leather fringes, which hold bullets
and powder and money and hemp-tobacco; their shaved
heads, with one long oiled and combed or plaited lock;
their turbans, red or brown, of strings of wool,&mdash;all
complete a Riffi, and a very fine-looking fellow he
can be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>
The labour element, which as a whole is antagonistic
to the spirit of Morocco, crops up here and there, less
in the casually fanned fields than in out-of-the-way
corners. The Potters' Caves just outside Tetuan constitute
one of those corners. There is always work going on
in the caves, and smoke coming out of one or other of
the many kilns, all the year round. Morocco and Moorish
architecture would be nowhere without the potteries.
Those infinitesimal little tiles which fit together and
make such artistic colour-patterns, lining the <i>al-fresco</i>
patios, facing the walls of the rooms, the pillars and
doorways and flooring, the houses throughout, are every
one of them kneaded and cut and baked there: crocks
to wash in, pans for charcoal, immense water-pots, small
water-pots, bowls and shallow basins, dishes of all sizes,
and saucers down to the smallest, even ink-bottles, all
come into being there.</p>

<p>Leaving the city by <i>B&aacute;b-el-Nooadtha</i> (the Gate of
Sheaves), a little winding path leads to the caves, which
lie among thickets of prickly pear, at the foot of the
Anjera Hills, out of which they have been hollowed,
probably by the action of water. Immense ramifications
they are&mdash;great dark halls, roofed <i>au naturel</i> in
corrugated rock with fissured sides, where maiden-hair
fern hangs cool and green. Here in the dark shadows
are a little company of workmen, chiefly in brown jellabs
and leathern aprons, one cutting squares out of the soft
clay with a penknife&mdash;he has a pattern to help him keep
them exact; another cuts diamonds, another stars: piled
up together, they look like little pastry shapes in brown,
beside the workmen, who are all sitting cross-legged on
the ground.</p>

<p>A little farther on two more men are dipping the
top surfaces of the diamonds into an earthenware bowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
full of yellow "cream," which will glaze and colour them,
all in one. This sulphur-colour, and a blue, and a white,
are generally used for the tiles&mdash;no other shades, as a rule.
A boy in a corner is at work at one of the first processes,
treading out a vast circle of yellowish clay into
the consistency of stiff dough. A rather superior old
Moor in a white turban, perhaps the master-workman,
is deftly cutting out rosettes. In the front of the cave
a little brown donkey, with pasterns as weak as a reed,
is standing under the weight of four great earthenware
pots full of water, two balanced on each side its pack.
A boy empties them one by one of the water, pouring
it into a natural basin scooped out in the ground, well
puddled with clay, and therefore without a leak. The
water is wanted to mix with the "dough." Then the
donkey patters off for another load, the boy sitting sideways
on its pack and shaking his heels&mdash;that makes
it go.</p>

<p>To the left stands a kiln in process of being packed
with millions of the clay dice, which, baked hard, dove-tailed
together, and forming a smooth, polished surface,
will keep many a room cool. The kiln next door to it,
is full of pots and pans of all shapes and sizes, but its
opening is plastered up with clay, and they are not to
be seen. Into the great fiery furnace underneath, a man
is thrusting dry brown bushes, and dried prickly pear,
and whatever rubbish will burn. Much of it has been
hacked off the hillside by women, and has come on their
backs many a mile. There is a crackling sound, smoke
comes out, and a pink flame glows behind the man's
body. The tiles ought to bake all right.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the same boy inside the cave has got his
clay into good order&mdash;it is about two inches thick, and
something the size of a big round table; then he stoops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>
down, and, with a knife held in both hands, scores the
clay across, much as toffee is scored; which done, each
square, about a foot in diameter, is carried off to be cut
up into little shapes or to go upon the potter's wheel.</p>

<p>The potter sat in his little pit, working the wheel with
his foot&mdash;as Carlyle says, "one of the venerablest objects,
old as the Prophet Ezekiel and far older. Rude lumps
of clay, how they spin themselves up, by mere quick
whirling, into beautiful circular dishes."</p>

<p>The potter thumped his wet clay; then, as the wheel
turned, pressed and moulded it with clever clay-encrusted
hands: the sleeves were turned back from his bony
chocolate-coloured arms. He had a grey goatee and a
quiet smile, a dirty turban round his head, a white tunic
mostly clay, and underneath a claret-coloured garment
showed at the neck.</p>

<p>He was a spare, wizened old man: perhaps his work,
like Dante's, had made him "lean for many years." The
faster his wheel revolved, the truer apparently was the shape
of the vessel he turned out. His country might accept
the lesson&mdash;that labour, like the wheel, conduces towards a
good end. I fancy that a decadent people, who will neither
work nor spin, but choose to rest and lie at ease, give
the potter Destiny no chance. He has no wheel, this
potter&mdash;for Morocco will not labour, nor be broken, nor
disciplined; and so he is reduced to a mere kneading and
baking, without the means he fain would employ; and he
turns out a mere makeshift&mdash;his production at best is
"not a dish; no, a bulging, kneaded, crooked, shambling,
squint-cornered, amorphous botch&mdash;a mere enamelled vessel
of dishonour."</p>

<p class="sc">Selling Earthenware Pots.</p>

<p>The great pot which the potter slowly evolved out of
the soft brown clay under our eyes was not perfect: he
made it entirely by eye, and it matched the rest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
group to the ordinary observer; yet it had a distinct
"lean." Did it grumble to itself, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">vessel of the more ungainly make?</p>
</div></div>

<p>as human vessels complain sometimes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>They sneer at me for leaning all awry;</p>
<p>What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?</p>
</div></div>

<p>Beyond the potter the ground was covered with an
army of his soft mud-coloured vessels, all sorted and
arranged in groups which matched, dozen after dozen, far
back into the inner shadows of the cave, like some weird
and interminable china shop. I gave the old man a
cigarette, which he puffed at over his wheel.</p>

<p>In the next cave a white-bearded Aaron was solemnly
dipping dishes into a bowl of blue colour and glaze, and
placing each with his finger and thumb on a board by him
among countless fellows, while with his other hand he
gravely swirled the liquid to prevent its setting. Others
next him were again cutting out shapes; and three potters
were hard at work, one moulding the bodies of pots,
another the necks, another the lids, while a fourth put all
three together.</p>

<p>And thus they laboured on. Their slippers lay in the
mouths of the caves beside their brown jellabs; and the
smell of the moist clay and the drip of water up amongst
the green fern mixed with the cool air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> walks began by degrees to tell upon our
boots, for the cobble-stones of Tetuan and the
rocks of Morocco in general are meant less for boots
than for bare feet, which they do not seem to damage.
In time, stress of circumstances drove us to a curly black-headed
Jew bootmaker, whose most expensive pair of
thick black boots cost nine shillings. Another Israelite
made us suits of rough brown jellab material, for the sum
of &pound;1 each&mdash;stuff which wore for ever.</p>

<p>The mountains on the opposite side of the river were
our El Dorado, but the river would not go down in January
and allow of our fording it; rain followed rain, and it was
higher than ever. One market day we walked down to
watch the people from the other side come across, on
their way into the sok, laden with country produce. Years
ago a bridge had been built over the Wad-el-Martine, but,
like other Moorish architecture, it was not built to last,
and the immense floods which swing down the Wad-el-Martine
in winter-time soon left only a broken pier
or two, to point out that a bridge had been thought of.
The money to build it was supplied by Government: half
of it went into the pocket of the builder; a little went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
towards the bridge, which naturally could only be built
of rubbish, without proper foundations. Now that there is
no bridge, it is once more, as it had been for ages upon
ages, a case of ferrying across by the big ferry-boat, or of
fording. Since ferrying means money, and fording only
a wetting, most of the market-goers ford.</p>

<p>It was a sight to see the countrywomen wading through,
one after another like a string of ducks, trying to keep
dry: the water came just about up to their bodies, and
the white haik and piece of towelling for a skirt could be
bundled up somehow&mdash;a very few wore short white cotton
drawers. Their legs were remarkable for an enormous
development of muscle in unusual places. Once across,
they wrung out anything which had been wetted, shivering
somewhat; then arranged their voluminous haiks afresh
over the mysterious great bundles on their backs, and,
padding off in single file, made for the city. What those
bundles, which bent their backs half double, had inside
them it was impossible to certify: often part of it was a
baby, judging by a round shape like a head under the
haik, and the fact that, when it had a knock, there was
a cry: the rest might be chickens, oranges, vegetables,
baskets of eggs, baskets of coos-coosoo, heads of brooms
made of bamboo, honey, and so on. Some of the chickens
dangled in front of the women by strings tied to their
waists: the chickens were alive, of course.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-26.png"><img src="./images/ill-26_th.png" alt="A FERRY-BOAT ON MARKET DAY." title="A FERRY-BOAT ON MARKET DAY." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">A Ferry-Boat on Market Day.</p>

<p>On the tops of their heads the women wore enormous
straw hats, with brims large enough to act as umbrellas
and to keep the rain off their shoulders. The ferry-boat,
packed with them <i>and</i> these straw hats, was worth seeing,
like a grand-stand in a shower hidden by umbrellas.
The weights which the women carry for hours at a
time are almost incredible; but they begin as tiny girls,
lopping along after their mothers at a half-run under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
tiny bundles, with the same bent backs; and habit is
second nature.</p>

<p>After the string of women came along a youth, with
two small donkeys, laden with panniers full of green
vegetables. The donkeys jibbed upon the brink; many
"Arrahs" and curses and much cudgelling with a
stick got them started; the panniers swayed horribly,
and threatened to turn completely round, as the current
pushed the donkeys over this side and that. Once in,
they made pluckily for the opposite shore; but the stream
carried them down; the water was well up their bodies;
the distracted boy plunged and struggled behind first
this one and then the other, whichever seemed in most
danger&mdash;for the ford was none too wide. Urging them
to keep up-stream, he clung on to one refractory pannier.
The water rose higher and almost took them off their
feet; but that was the worst place; now it was better.
The leading donkey was in safety in shallower water,
nearing dry land; but the other poor fellow seemed less
strong, and was not able to make half such a good fight
of it&mdash;its load may have been heavier. In spite of the
boy it got lower and lower down-stream: suddenly there
was an upheaval and a splash; its head went under
altogether, pack and everything in a hole. Then the
boy surpassed himself; for, deep as it was, he was there
in a moment, got hold of the donkey behind, and pushed
and half lifted, at no small risk to himself, and pulled,
until the little fellow, after several relapses, found his
feet. Finally, he waded out, and stood, like a drowned rat,
on the bank, pack and all streaming; then he collected
himself after a pause, and doddered off towards the
sok. The boy shook himself and his soaked clothes,
clutched his stick, and ran after his donkeys.</p>

<p>A well-to-do Moor, possibly a sheikh, was the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
to go for the ford. He probably farmed, and his sleek
mule was full of green corn and "beans." They were
things of colour, the pair of them: all the mule's appointments
scarlet, himself a glossy brown; while his master,
in dark blue, sat tight on his scarlet saddle, his bright
chased stirrups flashing, so short as to bring his feet
right up the mule's side&mdash;his turban, white as snow, with
the red peak of the fez underneath, the deepest blot of
colour, against the sky. A white garment waved out
in the breeze under the blue jellab; he sat straight as
a withy, feeling the mule's mouth with a hard hand,
and bringing its nose into the air. There were some
bravado and a great deal of assurance in the whole.
The world used him well. Moors ride everywhere, if they
possess anything with four legs. Why should they give
themselves the fatigue of walking? But besides that,
they are horsemen and most at home on a horse, while
their country is not one to travel in on foot.</p>

<p>Having decided that the river was fordable, and that
we ought to be able to ride across it, we walked back
by way of the city, and went in to tea with a Moor,
ordering a donkey to be sent out the next day to
Jinan Dolero, which should take us across to our
El Dorado. The Moor who entertained us was a certain
Ci Hamed Ghralmia, the eldest son of a Government
official who had fattened physically and financially on
the Customs, and whose fine house represented so many
perquisites and bribes, and so much pared off the lump
sum which went annually up to the Sultan.</p>

<p>It was as luxurious a house as Eastern could wish:
soft Rabat carpets, old Fez silk hangings, round the
four-post beds, standing back in recesses in the room into
which our host led us,&mdash;hangings such as even Fez can
no longer produce; such silk is not made. One piece,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
which was quite as handsome in its way, was made years
ago in Tetuan, from Tetuan silk-worms, reared on the
slopes outside the Mulberry Gate&mdash;spun, dyed, and woven
in Tetuan.</p>

<p>Couches and divans filled up the corners; glowing colours
and fine snowy linen abounded. It was a house in which
to spend a sleepy Sabbath afternoon on a hot day, if it
must be spent indoors. Cool air blew through the high
rooms; the splash and ripple of fountains rose and fell
in the cool marble patio below, and echoed up the tiled
staircase; while back, far in the shade of the secluded
rooms, among avenues of pillars, vistas of light and
shade, women like butterflies, in mauve and yellow and
white, rose from some soft scented divan and flitted across.
And in the centre of it all, a little king, Ci Hamed
Ghralmia&mdash;a pale, caf&eacute;-au-lait complexioned man, who
looked as if life had never shown him one of its angles.
He was fat and lineless: soft white hands, fleshy ankles,
no knots of muscle in so well-turned-out a mould of
cream, not a spot, not a flush, no sign of liver; the lips
slightly suggested sensuality, and there was a line of
cruelty round the mouth, but no further indication of
self-indulgence; he might have lived on sugar and chicken
coos-coosoo all his life, and altered in nothing but size
since he was a year old, except for a beard on the soft
white chin, and his eyes, which were infinitely cunning.
Brown and cold, like polished marbles, they had not
reached that stage of cunning which veils its cunning,
but would still gleam at the sight of money and express
satisfaction over a well-made bargain. They were suspicious,
as the ignorant generally are, and believed in
little that they saw. The old Biblical characters who
walk <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Morocoo'">Morocco</ins> to-day have most of them the same failing:
they are sly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
Ci Hamed Ghralmia was an "advanced" Moor&mdash;that
is to say, in the afternoons, lying on his divan, he read
Arabic books. He had bought some French knick-knacks
too. He told us that he rented a shop, in which he sat
in the mornings and chatted to his friends, using it
not in any way to dispose of any goods, of which it was
devoid, but as a sort of "club" or meeting-place. Then
in the afternoons he occasionally rode out on his mule.
He had a garden, I think, outside the city. Or he played
chess with a friend, or read. Perhaps he would use his
<i>hummum</i> (Turkish bath); he would pray at his own
particular mosque, regularly, so many times a day; and
he would drink much green tea, and consume sugar,
and sleep inordinately.</p>

<p>Thirty years of this life in Tetuan found Ci Hamed
Ghralmia still a contented man&mdash;supremely so. Wrapped
in the finest white wool and muslin clothes, he lay along
a divan opposite to us upon one elbow, the picture of
ease, and talked away. No Moor was ever anything
but self-composed. Upon our camera's coming out, he
was much interested; and to prove his progressive and
enlightened state of mind, let us photograph him just as
he lay there&mdash;a vast, voluminous white chrysalis. Then
he took us to see his wives and slaves&mdash;a large party
of them. They were allowed to come out on to the
staircase and talk to us; but when the interview had
lasted five minutes, Ci Hamed Ghralmia clapped his
hands twice&mdash;we had seen enough&mdash;every wife and every
slave vanished like magic.</p>

<p class="sc">The Author Fording the Wad-el-Martine.</p>

<p>The next morning we made one of many expeditions
up into the hills on the opposite side of the river, towards
the south, and in the direction, though somewhat west,
of the Riff. We rode in turns, it being somewhat of a
rest to scramble along on foot, to say nothing of exercise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
The big grey donkey had our lunch, a camera, some
field-glasses, and a box for botanical specimens slung
about him. We had a fairly intelligent boy&mdash;Mohammed,
a Riffi&mdash;and managed to understand a word or two he
said. It had been explained to him by S`lam that we
wished to get to the Blue Pool if possible. Arrived at
the river, we found nobody&mdash;not being market day, it
was utterly deserted. The current was still swirling in a
forbidding fashion, but Mohammed led the donkey straight
in with R.; he tucked up his clothes, held his yellow
slippers high in one hand, and after some goading they
landed on the opposite bank. Mohammed left his slippers,
rode back through the river for me, and in due time I
was deposited on the shingle. Off we set&mdash;first by a
narrow path, thick on each side with scented violets,
and closed in with the usual ten-foot-high cane fence.
More streams had to be forded, but they were small and
the donkey strong; so, to save time, I sat above his tail,
behind R., and he carried us across in one journey.</p>

<p>So far we were still down on the flats; the hills towered
in front of us; and among the streams, and where the
river in its vagaries had often flowed, there was deposited
many a rich bed of fruitful mud, turned into valuable
land, the very soil <i>par excellence</i> for oranges. And they
were all around us&mdash;garden after garden, acre after acre,
foliage studded with gold knobs by the million. And
among them, and as far as the eye could reach, up into
the gorge between the hills, picturesque white garden-houses
showed through rifts in the half-tropical foliage,
or over hedges of prickly pear and oleander. Fig-trees,
a hundred years old, made faded grey blotches
amongst the vivid greenery; the pink bloom of apricot
was stainless against stained-yellow walls. In such a
place, the inexorable realism of the age in which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
live, was shaken&mdash;spirits there surely were which should
appear.</p>

<p>We passed an old countrywoman with a tiny donkey
carrying two great panniers full of green-stuffs: she was
in difficulties, having a wrestle to make it cross a little
stream. Mohammed went to her assistance. Once over,
she climbed on its small back with the help of a stone,
putting her foot on its neck to get into her place.</p>

<p>And now, leaving the orange gardens and their wealth,
our path took an upward turn into a more rugged
country, a less fruitful soil. We left a field of pale blue
flax on the left&mdash;a "blue pool" indeed; and about this
point the donkey's pack, which had no breastplate, slipped
over its tail; but Mohammed's knife, and some string,
and the britching, put all to rights for the time being.
Later on a stirrup-leather broke.</p>

<p>Following our winding path, we reached at last a
white saint-house, which dominated a little hill overgrown
with gnarled grey olives, and acted guardian
over a large and flourishing village which lay below,&mdash;at
least it was a collection of mud huts, and more of
them than usual, but, like so many of these "villages,"
seemed to all intents and purposes deserted&mdash;a city of
the dead. Many of the inhabitants were out no doubt,
but those who were in were not tempted by curiosity
to stare at us: without windows there can be no signs
of the rites which are carried on inside the houses. All
we saw were dogs, fierce brutes, which stones alone kept
at a distance, where they sat showing their teeth and
bristling their crests ominously.</p>

<p>The saint-house, of course, was forbidden ground: we
went as close as common sense permitted, and from
under the shady olives looked back at Tetuan down
below us, a snow-white streak in the valley.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
Some rags were hanging upon a bush near us. It
is an interesting and curious practice, that of hanging
votive rags upon the bushes around chapels and holy
shrines: no less venerable is the performance of
pilgrimages to the same. Both practices go back into
the dim ages. They are in use to this day amongst
the Shintoists of Japan, and the inhabitants of Northern
Asia, India, the Orkneys, and remote corners of Ireland,
where sickly children are dipped in streams, or passed
through holes in stones or trees so many times running,
going against the way of the sun, in order to produce the
effect of making the sick child as strong as a lion. Then
an offering must be made to the saint, and a rag is torn
off somebody's garment, and tied to a bush near his
grave, to show that they would have done more for the
good saint if they had had the power.</p>

<p>Rag-trees, burdened with the tattered offerings of the
devout and impecunious tribes-people, flourish throughout
Morocco,&mdash;signs hanging out, and blown by the wind,
in the face of travellers; warnings of the deep-rooted
superstition entangled in the innermost heart-cells of
its people, to be disturbed at imminent peril.</p>

<p>Leaving the saint-house and village, we struck a path
upwards into a wild gorge, at the bottom of which a
brawling torrent was tumbling. It turned many rude
mills, and there were lush fields of corn on its banks.
Far away in the grey distance now, to the north, we
could see a dark wedge of rock, almost on the sky-line
beyond the Anjera and other hills of Morocco: <i>the</i>
Rock&mdash;Gibraltar.</p>

<p>At this point we lunched. Mohammed was provided,
and dropped behind a rock: the donkey grazed. A
little boy, minding goats, came up with a fascinating
pocket-knife, but would not let it go out of his hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>
A clear stream gave us drink&mdash;it was warm; bees hummed
in the balmy air; there was an aromatic scent; clouds
hung round the hills; the panorama below was essentially
peaceful and "Christian."</p>

<p>And then we went on in search of the far-famed Blue
Pool. But though we reached where the river lay in
still pools, blue beyond all known blues, we found no
more&mdash;only traces of a great flood and landslips, which,
I suspect, had washed away the lake people had talked
of. We found enough to bring us back on other days,
and to understand why the missionaries take up their
tents and camp in the mountains in the summer.</p>

<p>We returned by a path farther west, and passed a great
olive wood full of black shadows. The scrub on the
hillsides holds pig&mdash;there are plenty of them; and the
boars become more or less antagonistic at certain times
in the year. We were told tales of people who had met
with terrifying adventures, but personally our expeditions
had no such thrilling incidents connected with them.</p>

<p>It would have been unwise to stay out after sunset,
and that time always saw us back at Jinan Dolero. It
is said to be the most unsafe hour; for men are coming
into Tetuan, and if they can waylay and rob or murder
a traveller, and make their way into the city before the
gates shut, half an hour after sunset, and sleep there, who
shall suspect them of dark deeds done outside in the
evening? Besides, Mohammed would never have consented
to be out late, on account of the firm belief which
Moors have in evil spirits. There is a special race of
beings, they hold, in many respects like men, in others
like spirits, called <i>ginns</i>. Their principal abode is the
under-world, but they come up on to the earth, and are
fond of lurking in wells and in dark corners, even in
houses. Rooms are often haunted by ginns: men are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
surrounded by ginns. Some of the more enlightened
Moors are inclined to represent ginns as merely superstitious
imaginations and hallucinations on the part of
the ignorant; but probably in his heart of hearts, no
Moor but has a secret desire to propitiate ginns, and
a secret dread of falling in with them.</p>

<p>Ginns eat and drink and propagate their species, and
even form sexual connections with men. A man whose
wife is any way odd or mysterious has married of course
a ginn. Ginns are fond of inhabiting rivers, woods, the
sea, ruins, springs, drains, and caves; they come out at
night more than by day, and in certain streets no Moor
will walk at night. Nor will a Moor sleep alone in a
room. Ginns, when they appear, take the forms of men,
goats, cats, dogs, almost any animal in fact, and also
monsters.</p>

<p>Whirlwinds, and shooting stars, and dear times, and
famine, and epidemics, are all caused by ginns. It is
the ginns who have eaten all the food in the city when
prices are exorbitant. If a man falls down in the dark,
it is a ginn: a sudden illness or an accident is the work
of a ginn. There are good ginns, but bad ginns are
more common. The worst of them all is <i>Iblis</i> (the
devil). Iblis tempts men to wickedness. All iniquity is
the fault of Iblis.</p>

<p>In order to keep the bad ginns at a distance, certain
precautions may be taken. Salt and steel are antidotes.
Salt in the hand when going out at night, salt in the
pillow when sleeping, are measures which should be used.
In building a house some people put salt and wheat and
an egg into the ground, and kill a goat on the threshold.
On sinking a well (the stronghold of ginns) a goat or
sheep must always be killed.</p>

<p>The best talisman against ginns is the repetition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
certain passages in the Kor&#257;n: when passing a dark spot,
say the "Ajatu-l-kursi": as for neglecting to say "B`ism
Allah" (In the name of God) before going for a ride, or
before doing any sort or kind of action, why, that is to
have a ginn as your companion on your horse, and at
your elbow, whatever you may be doing. As every place
has its "owners," its good or bad ginns, on striking a
light and going into a room Moors say, "Good-evening
to you, O ye owners of the place." And if a tent is to
be pitched, first of all the protection of good ginns must
be solicited in that spot.</p>

<p>Supposing a ginn gets hold of a man, and he is ill,
there are certain doctors, magicians, among the Moors
who can cast the ginn out. They practice a regular
"ginn-cult," and celebrate annual feasts, going outside
Tetuan to a certain spring near the Moorish cemetery,
and killing a bullock, a black goat, a black donkey, and
some chickens.</p>

<p>The word <i>ginn</i> originally meant "the secret," "the
mysterious," "the hidden"; and the belief in ginns is
part of the actual creed of Mohammedans, Arabs, and
Berbers alike. But Moors have a hundred superstitions.
They believe that all animals had a language once upon
a time,&mdash;that the horse prays to Allah when he stretches
out his leg; that the donkey which falls down, asks
Allah that the same may happen to his master. They
say that the donkey was once a man whom Allah
changed into his present shape because he washed himself
with milk; that the stork was a <i>kadi</i>, or judge, who
was made a stork because he passed unjust sentences
upon his fellow-men. It is therefore a sin to kill a
stork, or a crow, or a toad, or a white spider, or a white
chicken. A white spider once spun its web over a cave
where Mohammed hid: his enemies saw it, thought there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>fore
that no one could have recently entered the cave,
and passed on.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say, that about Death&mdash;the
Great Secret&mdash;there are numerous superstitions. There
were too many funerals in Tetuan: early in the afternoon
one was often encountered at the Gate of the Tombs;
death would only have taken place that morning, without
much inquiry as to its cause, and whether by fair means
or foul nobody knew and few cared. The procession
came swinging along, stately men in flowing garments,
white and dark, chanting the weird funeral hymn or
"lament"&mdash;always the same mournful, monotonous cadence,
rising and falling in the narrow streets, and at last out
into the air. And then once through the B&aacute;b-el-M`kabar,
the great company in white turn into the Moorish burial-ground,
and arrange themselves in a long line against
the hillside, and the chant becomes general, almost a
great cry, full of the strange fascination of certain Eastern
music, withal so unintelligible to Europeans.</p>

<p>The body, loosely wrapped in white, lies on an open
bier. After a sort of service on that rough hillside
against the walls of the city, the procession winds on
again to the shallow grave: a last chant, and the body
goes into the earth, and is quickly covered. A scribe,
or reader, is left behind when every one has gone: he
reads pieces out of the Kor&#257;n over the grave, and
chants. Friends, mourners perhaps, will come out on
other days, and sit round the tomb, reading the Kor&#257;n
together, and singing the weird, sad melodies. You may
see them. But I have never seen a Moor give way to
the slightest outward expression of grief.</p>

<p>Mohammedans firmly believe, of course, in a Paradise
to which the good are admitted: their conception as to
this land of the hereafter, largely consisting of gardens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>
and shade, adds a bridge, by which means alone access
to Paradise is gained. The bridge (<i>Al Sirat</i>) is finer
than a hair and sharper than a sword: the wicked invariably
turn giddy and fall off into the pit of Hell, while
the righteous negotiate it in safety.</p>

<p>A rich man, when he is buried, is provided with a vault.
The body is laid on its right side, its sightless eyes turned
to Mecca. During the first night, Mohammedans hold
that the soul remains in the body for the purpose of
being interrogated by two angels before it can be admitted
into Paradise. They appear, and the body is roused to
a sitting posture and to temporary life. It replies to
the dread examination. If this ends unsatisfactorily, the
angels torture and beat the body, until the sepulchre
closes in upon it. But if they approve the soul's replies,
they bid the man sleep on in peace in the protection
of God.</p>

<p>Travellers complain of a want of "pageant" in Morocco.
Ostentatious funerals and processions of all sorts, public
demonstrations over trifles, the worship of gilt and glitter,
and the emotional spirit called <i>loyalty</i>, of the present
day, do not exist in El Moghreb. There is a spirit of
simplicity about its shows; they do not breathe of money:
old as their customs are, there is vigour in them and a
certain amount of use, for the people have not outgrown
them, do not make of them so many lay figures on which
to display signs of their own great wealth.</p>

<p>The Day of the Great Feast up at Court with the
Sultan, that is <i>the pageant</i> in all Morocco. We missed it.</p>

<p>Connected with the bashas and kaids, who are the only
great men in the country or in the cities, there is little
or no respect or formality. Only on Sundays a sort of
"flash in the pan" reminds the Moor that he has a little
despot in his midst, who is more or less lord of his life;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
and the drums are heard all over the city, the soldiers
turn out, for the basha goes to pray at <i>El Aoli</i> (noon)
in his own particular mosque opposite his house.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Sabbath, the biggest <i>sok</i> (market) in all
the week, a little black flag was flown from the mosque-tops
early in the morning to remind Tetuan of the holy
day. The basha was inside the cool mosque, praying, at
the hottest time of the day; outside a few people collected,
though the same event happened every Friday. No
Moor is ever busy, ever hurries, but can always wait.
At a quarter to one a bugler on the east side of the
street, who had been sitting in the sun with his bugle,
got up and blew a call to fall in. About sixty soldiers,
who had all strolled off after the great man had disappeared
into the mosque, sauntered up from different
directions. If they were a ragged and indifferently drilled
company, there was colour in the ranks at least. Every
man wore a short scarlet flannel tunic, a pair of white
cotton drawers, and a red fez: one drummer had a tunic
of beetle-green. As they lined the street, short sturdy
men, with hairy legs and coffee-coloured faces, their bright
bayonets flashing in the sun, the drums thumping and
the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'trumpter'">trumpeter</ins> running up and down the scale, the dazzling
sunlight gave a trace of splendour to the medley of
scarlet and steel against the whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>Everybody waited expectant. A stout man in white
came out of the mosque, ordered the small boys away,
and saw that there was ample room for the basha to
pass across the street and into his own house. Then
the ordinary crowd of worshippers began to file out of
the building&mdash;prayers over: green-blue kaftans lined with
crimson silk, filmy white robes, snowy turbans, moved
slowly along&mdash;a dignified, impressive crowd. There was
a pause before the basha appeared, a man arranging his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
two yellow slippers side by side upon the doorstep of
the mosque. Another moment and the great, voluminous,
expected figure filled the doorway. A twist of his
ankles and he was in his slippers, the bugle sounded,
the ragged squad presented arms somewhat untidily, a
line of servants bowed themselves low and respectfully
before him, and the basha moved slowly across the
street.</p>

<p>Leading his own troops, dispensing justice, an after-type
of those great Arabs who sprang from the sands
of Arabia and Africa, shook Europe, and flourished in
Spain, a basha should be no tyrant, but a courteous
gentleman, a noble of "The Arabian Nights." But there
was no aristocratic trace about Asydaibdalkdar. Carrying
his rosary in his hand, clothed entirely in white, his
features bore traces of servility and sensuality, the result
of poisoning the Arab and Berber blood with the strain
from Central Africa. Slavery is proving fatal to the
Moorish race. Unlike the well-bred Moor, the basha's
face was deeply lined: cruelty, cunning, pigheadedness,
all fought for the upper hand in his swarthy countenance.
He walked in under his own gateway into a courtyard
beyond: there he sat down in a corner upon a seat&mdash;a
great figure, much like some Indian god&mdash;while his
underlings came forward, stood in a semicircle, bowed
low, and saluted him; followed by his soldiers, who
marched in single file into the courtyard, round it, past
their chief, and out again&mdash;this three times, to the sound
of drums; then, headed by the officer in command, they
trooped off to the barracks, the basha's gateway was
locked, and Church Parade was over.</p>

<p class="sc">The Basha Going to Pray.</p>

<p>For half an hour all the gates of the city had been
barred and bolted, while prayers were going on&mdash;there
being a superstition among the Moors, arising from an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
old prophecy, that on a certain morning of a Mohammedan
Sabbath, Christians will gain possession of the cities while
the kaids and bashas are in the mosques.</p>

<p>Two hundred soldiers are allowed by Government to the
governor of Tetuan, by means of which he is to maintain
law and order. However, a hundred only were maintained,
and the pay of the remaining half went into somebody's
pocket. There was apparently little for them to do;
drill was a thing unheard of, and they spent most of
the day hanging round the basha's house or doing
errands for him.</p>

<p>On the feast days there was <i>Lab-el-Barod</i>&mdash;the famous
"Powder Play" of Morocco; and then the soldiers all
turned out into the <i>feddan</i> (the great market-square),
and showed what Lab-el-Barod meant: to me rather
a foolish game, with but one interesting point&mdash;that it
is the imitation of the old Arab tribal battle. To-day
the Moors gallop forward, stand up in their saddles, fire
their guns under their horses' necks, over their tails&mdash;all
this at full gallop&mdash;throw their guns into the air
and catch them, and last of all pull up in an incredibly
short space, dragging their horses right on to their
haunches, which evolutions are imitations of what their
ancestors did with spear and javelin. Lab-el-Barod prevailed
in Spain till the middle of the eighteenth century,
and it is still played in the East with reeds. There
is of course a picturesque element in it&mdash;white turbans,
white garments streaming in the wind, scarlet saddles,
flashing steel, hard-held horses with yards of tail, and
above all, the lithe figures in perfect balance whatever
their positions; but the performance is often too "ragged"
to be impressive, and it strenuously demands flats of
desert as a background.</p>

<p>The basha would always come out and look on when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
there was one of these "field days" at Tetuan: his
figure was not adapted to his participation therein, being
perfectly in keeping with his walk in life, and that walk
consisted in his sitting from six o'clock to ten o'clock
in the morning, and from three o'clock to six o'clock
in the afternoon, in a small open room off the street
opposite his house, in a reclining position upon cushions,
before him an excited group (as often as not), contradicting,
swearing, gesticulating, abusing, all at the same
moment&mdash;one of whom is carried off by the soldiers to
be flogged, another is sent to prison, or, if the seekers
after justice wax more troublesome than ordinary, they
may all be thrown into prison by the heels together to
calm them. At the same time the basha absorbs bribes,
and sweeps loaves of sugar, packets of candles, and
pounds of tea into his net. These are the ordinary
bribes.</p>

<p>When he was appointed basha, a royal letter from
the Sultan was sent to Tetuan and read aloud in the
mosque: then he entered upon his duties. He must
needs go warily from day to day; and even then luck
may desert him at any moment, and a summons may
arrive from the Sultan&mdash;he is to go to Court at once.
I recollect in what abject terror, one basha, who was sent
for at a day's notice, set out upon his journey, only to
find, when he got to Court, that he was to have a more
lucrative billet and a higher post of honour. Many who
have departed in terror, all unknowing of the future, have
found, when they reached Fez or Morocco City, where-ever
the Sultan might be, that their worst fears were
realized. Either placed under arrest, tortured, imprisoned,
or bastinadoed, the little wealth they had accumulated
is extorted from them, under the pretext of there being
arrears in taxes or other dues, which must be made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
good. The wooden jellab is used for the purpose of
extorting confession in the case of imaginary wealth
supposed to be hidden (and much often is hidden): it is
made of wood, resembling in shape a long cloak, and
placed in an upright position; the inside is lined with
iron points, which prevent the body from resting against
it without suffering. Inside this "jellab" the basha is
squeezed, standing up, and he remains there on a sparse
diet of bread and water till he divulges.</p>

<p>Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of War were
sent to the prison in Tetuan soon after the accession of
the present Sultan; but that was for plotting against his
life. In the common gaol, heavily chained, under the
same roof with the herd of common prisoners, all they
were allowed was a curtain across one corner, behind which
they sat. The Prime Minister died there. The Minister
of War is there to-day, March 1902, and, after over seven
years' confinement, getting fat. Some members of the
Rahamna tribe are there also. This tribe, which belongs
to the far south, near Morocco City, about eight years ago
was in a state of rebellion, to quell which the Sultan
sent his army with orders to <i>eat them up</i>. Their fat lands
and fine gardens were ruined; men, women, and children
killed and taken prisoners; while six hundred of them were
sent to the Tetuan prison, and a great number&mdash;I do not
know exactly&mdash;went to Rabat. That was eight years ago.
Sixty of them are in Tetuan prison now, the remnant of
six hundred. There is a kaid among them who is very
ill, dying: the eight years have done for him.</p>

<p>Since this was written, an order has come from the
Sultan for the release of the Rahamna tribesmen. In
Rabat, unfortunately, almost all who were in the Kasbah
prison died long ago. Its insanitary condition has earned
for it the name of <i>Dar-el-Mout</i> (the House of Death).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>
But in the other prison there were survivors. These came
out with traces of the late governor's butchery.</p>

<p>For trying to send a written petition to the Sultan three
years ago, which set forth their condition, and prayed that
after five years' confinement they might be considered to
have paid for their rebellious deeds, and be allowed to
return to their own land for the last years of their lives,
the late governor, Ba Hamed, gave orders that their
hands should be mutilated. A knife was drawn across the
back of the wrist, cutting the extensor tendons of the
hand: the hand was packed with salt, and sewn up in
wet cow-hide. When this was taken off or wore off, it was
not recognizable as a hand.</p>

<p>Miss Hanbury, who did her best to institute reforms
in Moorish prisons, and succeeded in Tangier, left at
her death a sum of money, out of which &pound;5 came to
Tetuan to be spent on their behalf. It fell into the hands
of the lady missionaries, and they spent it in making
jellabs for the prisoners to wear, whose garments are
worse than filthy. Unfortunately &pound;5 was not nearly
enough to clothe all; it only provided a jellab for one
out of every three of the prisoners, and the poor wretches
fought like dogs for them.</p>

<p>"They will wear them in turns," the gaoler said. He
and another Moor had superintended the distribution of
them; and to their lasting disgrace, deaf to argument and
remonstrance on the part of the missionaries, they each
appropriated a jellab to himself, saying, "This is my
share; this goes to me." They were of coarse material,
such as neither gaoler nor under-gaoler would ever wear
themselves: all they would do would be to take them
into market and convert them into money.</p>

<p>"Moors have <i>no</i> feelings," people say, and say wrongly;
but that, to a great extent, it is true take just one instance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>&mdash;the
state of the prisons and prisoners. It was enough in
the distance to "wind" the Tetuan prison. There remains
the reflection&mdash;call it comforting if you like&mdash;that a people
who consent to endure such filth, and misery, and harsh
treatment, are not affected by them in the same way in
which a highly civilized people would be affected.</p>

<p>It is absurd to blame the Moorish Government; it is
absurd to say, "The people are obliged to endure." No
people can be forced to endure: a point comes beyond
endurance, and they rebel, choosing death rather. The
vigorous and progressive race endures least. Therefore
on the Moors' own heads be the state of their prisons,
the treatment of their prisoners: to that cursed spirit of
<i>laissez-faire</i> half the blame is due; the rest comes of
their indifference to suffering, to bad smells and dirt and
a sedentary existence. It is manifestly unfair to blame
certain ministers and officials. Taking into consideration
the manners and customs, hopes and fears, of the Moorish
people, their prisons probably suit them right well, and
they need no pity.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was not always easy to get provisions, except life's
bare necessities, in Tetuan. Provision Stores, which were
long out of their goods, always had the same answer when
asked for them&mdash;"M&#257;nana" (To-morrow); and to-morrow
never came. But it is unwise to "hustle the East": men
have died trying to find a way of doing so. Therefore we
chewed with philosophy the cud of the Moorish proverb:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>Manage with bread and butter till God brings the jam.</i>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the whole we fared not amiss, while our establishment,
with its two Riffi servants, man and wife, worked
well, until an occurrence took place which shook it to its
very foundations, and left us to the end with a question
which will never be solved.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
One evening, about half-past five, just as we had settled
ourselves down after tea to read, there was an unusual
stir on the stairs. A minute later and the door burst
open. Tahara staggered in, followed by S`lam, who seemed
very much excited and alarmed. The woman was deathly
pale; her eyes were ringed with black. R. and I, seeing
she was ill, jumped to the conclusion that something or
other was very wrong with her, and tried to make her sit
down, or lie down, at once, on our divan. In a confused
scene which followed, the only words we grasped were,
"Tabiba, tabiba" (Doctor), and S`lam, at our instigation,
rushed downstairs to go off to Tetuan, and to bring back
with him Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;, one of the lady missionaries.
Tahara was almost beside herself, apparently with terror,
and for a few moments one was inclined to doubt her
sanity. We tried vainly to quiet her, almost holding her
on the divan; but there was evidently something on her
mind which every moment threw her into fresh agitations,
and&mdash;<i>ah! what would we not have given to have understood
Arabic!</i> for Tahara knew no French, like S`lam,
and could barely say half a dozen words in English; her
Spanish, of which she knew a few words, was Greek to
us too.</p>

<p>"Signorita! signorita! tabiba!" she kept repeating,
wailing, and then a torrent of Shillah and Arabic and
Spanish would follow, and we were at our wits' end. At
last R. managed to quiet her a little, and by-and-by to
make her try to help us to understand, by saying slowly
in Arabic two or three words which would be intelligible
to us, together with the word or so of English which
she herself knew. Then we gathered that her one desire
was that I should go to the tabiba's. But why? We
told her that S`lam had gone. She burst out into fresh
agonies and shrieks: "S`lam not go! S`lam not go!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
Then she got up, and apparently wished to go downstairs&mdash;the
last thing we thought she ought to do; but all
our efforts to keep her still seemed rather futile; and from
what she was trying to make us understand, there was
more behind than we had an idea of. She went, almost
ran, down into her and S`lam's bedroom, we following
hard behind. Inside the room she tip-toed up to a recess
high in the wall, almost out of her reach, and with difficulty
lifted down a small bundle of rags. This she unrolled,
fold after fold, before our eyes, while a thousand guesses
as to what was coming rushed through the brain; the
last rag came off, and a small blue bottle, about four
inches high, lay in her hand. She held it up to the light.
It was half full of a colourless liquid like water. We
read the label&mdash;"Prussic Acid. Poison"; and an ugly
fear took the place of vague conjecture.</p>

<p>"Who has eaten this?" R. asked in scanty Arabic.</p>

<p>"Anna" (I), replied Tahara.</p>

<p>The remedy of hot boiled milk rushed into both our
heads at once, but Tahara was again beginning in a fresh
agony, which was now more persistent than only terrified;
and choking off her stream of words, we managed to
gather, that what she wanted was to go herself with me
into the city, at once, to Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;. Now a few
drops of prussic acid of course meant that she had
not long to live, and yet there were no symptoms of
poisoning so far as we could gather at present. She
might have taken it in a diluted form certainly. The
whole thing was possibly wild imagination on her part.
At any rate Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; would understand her, and that
we could not do.</p>

<p>I hurried on my boots, questioning as to whether the
woman really meant that S`lam had poisoned her. R.
helped Tahara wind her long white woollen haik round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
her. In two minutes I was ready. Tahara slipped into
her slippers, and, with the white shrouded figure clinging
to me, in the fast-deepening dusk we started.</p>

<p>It took fully twenty minutes to walk from Jinan Dolero
to the house in the middle of the city where the lady
missionaries lived and had a dispensary. Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; had
had some medical experience, and was a clever woman.
She understood, probably as far as any European can
understand, the Moorish character; and it was with
some confidence&mdash;possibly on the part of us both&mdash;that
we set out. But the way seemed lengthy; I knew that
S`lam would be there long before we could arrive:
through the city there are at least three intricate ways
by which the house is reached, and my heart sank as
I reflected that there was every chance of Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; and
S`lam's taking another way than our own, and thus missing
us. Meanwhile, it was growing darker every moment.
Would the city gate still be open when we reached
it? Was it not certain to be shut when we wanted to
return?</p>

<p>Tahara hung on to my arm and hand. There had
been rain, and we both slipped about in the dark, and
splashed into unseen pools; she took off her pink slippers
and carried them in one hand, and paddled along on
her bare feet at a Moorish woman's top speed, still
shaking with terror. Three or four times, dark as it was,
she stopped and put out her tongue for me to look at it.
It seemed very pink, and I did my utmost to reassure
her, having disturbing visions of her collapsing altogether
on the grass; for if she was to be understood rightly and
believed, she had pains in her body, and breathing seemed
an effort.</p>

<p>We were crossing the cemetery now by one of the
intricate paths which intersect it. There seemed not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>
soul within sight or sound. Every Moor would be inside
his house or hut. I hoped Tahara would pull herself
together and last as far as Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;'s.</p>

<p>She said she was <i>bueno</i>, meaning good, better, and
spoke again of the bottle which she was carrying carefully
hidden in her waistband. Then, as far as I could understand,
she wished me to know that the poison had something
to do with the signoritas&mdash;ourselves&mdash;and our food.
This was a most unpleasant reflection: I devoutly hoped
that R. would not begin dinner before I got back, and
comforted myself with the assurance that it was unlikely,
there being no one to get it ready. We had no outside
man at that time sleeping in the house.</p>

<p>"S`lam <i>no</i> good; S`lam <i>no</i> good," Tahara kept repeating.
And, to tell the truth, our long-legged ruffian
rose before my eyes as no mean embodiment of a stage
villain. The Riffis are notoriously treacherous and put
no value whatever on life; at the same time I knew that
they made good and faithful servants up to a certain
point, and I shrank from distrusting a man who had so
far served us well. And yet, how much does one know
of them? Nothing. We had had suspicions that all was
not going smoothly with the two servants: though they
had been married so lately there was friction between
them; Tahara had been heard crying at night, and had
looked red-eyed. It was likely, therefore, that there had
been a quarrel.</p>

<p>S`lam's old mother may have made mischief. She was
madly jealous of Tahara, whom S`lam had married without
letting her know. He had gone over to Tangier;
had arranged the marriage with Tahara's brother, who was
living at Tangier with her; had brought her off, hardly
a happy or willing bride, for he told us that she cried
the whole of the journey; and had sprung her upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
his old mother at Tetuan. In his bachelor days S`lam's
earnings had gone to the old woman. Now they were
spent on his wife and himself. Therefore Maman saw
nothing that was good in Tahara, and would have
given much, no doubt, to see the last of her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the city gate drew near. Tahara was moving
along firmly with her hand in mine. The gate was still
open!&mdash;that was a relief. We hurried through, and, seeing
a group of soldiers waiting outside, I judged that it was
just about to be shut. We were none too soon: the bars
behind us clanged into their places. I much wished that
R. was not henceforth cut off from all communication
with me, and left outside the city entirely by herself:
there were the two guns and revolver; after all, the house
was no more likely to be molested on this night than
on any other.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-29.png"><img src="./images/ill-29_th.png" alt="THE FEDDAN, TETUAN." title="THE FEDDAN, TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">The Feddan, Tetuan.</p>

<p>The narrow streets were nearly pitch dark; shadowy
figures passed us at first; and Tahara drew her haik all
over her face, leaving only a slit for the eyes, and put
on her slippers once more. Occasionally a little shop
had its hard-working inmate, sewing at slippers by the
light of an oil lamp; but for the most part all was black
darkness. How long the intricate streets seemed! We
stumbled on the rough cobbles and slid into the muddy
gutter. Tahara's slippers again impeded her, and off they
came. I wished devoutly I knew where Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; was,
and could make straight for her, probably hurrying at
that moment for Jinan Dolero, somewhere in the maze
of streets and houses. We crossed the great open
feddan, all deserted, and I strained my eyes for a glimpse
of her tall figure beside that of S`lam's&mdash;in vain.</p>

<p>Late as it was, children were about; they collected
gradually behind us and followed us, nor was it easy at
that time of night to drive them off. Tahara, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>
still struggling on, was leaning heavily on my arm. The
sooner we get to the Mission House the better.</p>

<p>Two more narrow lanes, a last winding alley, and the
welcome door of the tabiba's&mdash;never more welcome.</p>

<p>I called to Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; as I led Tahara into the courtyard.
Her answering voice was all I would have prayed
for at that moment. She was just starting with S`lam.
Leading Tahara to the door, we found him on the
threshold, with his old mother, whom he must have
gone first to fetch&mdash;Maman, whom R. and I had
ever distrusted: feeling that she was after no good the
first time she came to the house, we had limited her
visits.</p>

<p>I told S`lam to stay outside. He did not seem
astonished at seeing his wife and myself, asking not a
single question of either. Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; took Tahara upstairs
into her bedroom, and I followed, explaining that Tahara
did not want any one else to come in. For a moment or
two, after we got her up into the room, all her old terror
seemed to return; she was unable to speak, and collapsed
upon the floor&mdash;a ghastly colour. Briefly explaining to
Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; that Tahara believed herself to be poisoned, we
knelt down on the floor and examined her. There were
no apparent symptoms of poisoning&mdash;none; she was only
cold and terrified beyond words. Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; did her
best to calm her, and laughed away her fears, hoping to
get rid of the state of panic which her condition suggested
more than any poisoning.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done was to persuade Tahara
to explain matters to Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;. This might have been
easy enough at Jinan Dolero with S`lam out of the way;
but here, feeling that he and Maman were under the
very windows, her terror was abject, and I almost gave
up hope of getting a syllable out of her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
We shut every window, we shut the door, we pulled
down the blinds, to satisfy her; we even stopped up
the ventilation-holes; and then she still hesitated and
trembled.</p>

<p>At last, crouched on the floor, Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; kneeling by
her, Tahara, with her mouth at Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;'s ear, murmured
her tale in Arabic, while I wished I could understand.
<i>S`lam had given her poison. People in the city had
spoken against her and said evil things about her. S`lam
was jealous. He had been very angry. They had quarrelled,
and he had poisoned her. But he must never, never, on
any account, know that she had been to the tabiba's to
tell the tale. If S`lam suspected that Tahara knew he
had tried to poison her, and had told us of it&mdash;well, her
life was not worth a flus.</i> Even I knew that. Then
in a fresh agony of terror she crouched on the floor. I
told her to show Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; the bottle. Now to part with
the bottle, or to run the faintest risk of S`lam's seeing
it, was evidently a nightmare to the poor girl. If he
ever found out that she had taken it and brought it to
Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; . . .</p>

<p>We wasted many precious moments in trying to persuade
Tahara to take it out of her belt, where it lay
concealed, and show it to Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;. She looked at the
curtains, at the door. Could S`lam possibly see? At last,
more or less by force, I got possession of it, handed it to
Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; with one hand, and kept Tahara still on the
floor with the other.</p>

<p>The stopper of the bottle, Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; thought, had a
suspicious smell, but she gave it as her verdict that the
bottle itself contained nothing but water. She recognized
it at once as having belonged to S`lam's late master, who
always kept drugs in his house, and the name of whose
English chemist was on the label.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; poured a teaspoonful into a tumbler, and
returned the bottle to Tahara, who was getting rabid at
the delay. The teaspoonful we decided should be given
to one of Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;'s little chickens which she was
rearing. I said I would come in the morning and hear
her report.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tahara had refolded and hidden the precious
bottle as it was before, and Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; had managed more
or less to reassure her, promising her that she was not
poisoned this time, and laughing at her panic. The pain
of which she had complained had no doubt a natural
cause: giddiness might come on through bending over the
charcoal fire cooking dinner, Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; told her. Now
Tahara's only terror was that S`lam should ever find out
what had happened. The bottle must be taken home&mdash;must
be replaced exactly where it had been found.</p>

<p>Unsatisfactory as such a course was, there was some risk
in pursuing any other. S`lam, if he found out that his
wife had betrayed him or had suspected him and come
to us, might shoot her like a dog, in a passion, and be
inside the borders of the Riff in a few hours. And who
would blame him, if he gave as his reason for his whole
line of conduct that his wife had been unfaithful to him,
false though such a statement might be?</p>

<p>A girl in Tetuan a few years ago was <i>suspected</i> of having
been seduced. Her father took her and her mother out
to the Mussulman cemetery, within sight and hearing of
the city&mdash;the girl was sixteen: he shot her on the road,
and he and the mother dug a grave and buried her by
the roadside. They went home, and no one said a word.
The man still lives in Tetuan.</p>

<p>Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; evidently shared Tahara's fears, and was
anxious to allay any suspicions which S`lam might begin
to entertain. First, however, she found out from Tahara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
that S`lam had no intention of poisoning the signoritas
(<i>us</i>)&mdash;that was <i>quite</i> a mistake&mdash;at least so the girl assured
her. Then, having once more reassured Tahara about
her own health, Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; led her downstairs; there
she explained to S`lam and to his old mother that the
girl was very nervous, that she had not felt well, was to
take a pill that night (one had been given her), and
was to keep quiet to-morrow, in which case she ought
soon to be quite right.</p>

<p>Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; wanted to walk out with me and to sleep
at Jinan Dolero, evidently not liking our passing a night
alone under such suspicious circumstances; but I was
convinced there was no cause for fear, and I think we
both knew that the less we made of what had happened
the better; so, borrowing a lantern, I started back for
Jinan Dolero, Tahara clinging to my arm, S`lam lighting
the way, and the old mother following.</p>

<p>Arrived at the city gate, it was shut. I had a strange
wait alone with Tahara and Maman, while S`lam fetched
a soldier to unbar the gate. The basha's leave had to
be got, and the basha sent to the English Vice-Consul
to ask if it was his will that the gate should be opened
for a British subject. Eventually we got through, all except
Maman, who said good-night and went home.</p>

<p>It was a cheering sight to see at last a little light
far away in the valley where our house lay&mdash;the only
light visible. R. had left the curtains undrawn. In good
time we reached the garden-house. I took Tahara straight
into the bedroom, S`lam going to the kitchen to prepare
dinner. The little bottle in its wrappings was immediately
replaced in its niche, and Tahara ate some food which
we brought her. S`lam, as usual, waited on us: he was
oddly obsequious and deprecating in his manner, and I
could not quite understand it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
The night passed quietly. Early next morning
Maman appeared, which neither of us liked, but she
had come ostensibly to ask after Tahara, who had quite
recovered. I walked into the city, and went to the Mission
House to see Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;. The chicken was quite as well
as Tahara, and the liquid which at least one of them had
taken was probably water. Even so, the mystery was
not cleared up. If it was water, why did S`lam keep it
wrapped up, and why did Tahara think it was poison?
It was half empty. If Tahara had ever seen it full,
somebody must have drunk a dose. Of course S`lam's
old master had not left a bottle of prussic acid about,
and then not missed it. He probably emptied the bottle
and then threw it away; it might have had a drop or two
left in it, and the bottle may have been filled up with
water; but that was pure conjecture.</p>

<p>The poisons Moors so easily get, and which S`lam or
his mother could supply themselves with, are generally
in a powder form. I do not know how they would mix
with water: they are generally slow in working, sometimes
weeks in taking effect. There was no reason why Tahara
should not be poisoned by such a drug, and yet feel no
ill effects for the present. Thus we argued. Poisoning
in Morocco is such an every-day occurrence that it was
a most ordinary suspicion on Tahara's part. After all,
there might be nothing in it, but merely a fear grounded
on all sorts of reasons and assumptions. It is only a
matter of sitting down and thinking to conjure up plenty
of fears in Morocco.</p>

<p>Feeling that it was not pleasant to have a bottle
marked "Poison" in the house, and not to be positive
as to its contents, I resolved to empty and wash it
out, sending the so-called "water" to an analyst at
Tangier, and refilling the bottle with <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> water before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
replacing it. The chicken test was not thoroughly
satisfactory. As matters stood, Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; decided to
come out that afternoon to our house, while S`lam should
be sent away on an errand, in order that Tahara might
be interrogated and the thing ended.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-30.png"><img src="./images/ill-30_th.png" alt="CHARMING SNAKES." title="CHARMING SNAKES." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Charming Snakes.</p>

<p>Arrived home, I found that S`lam had been dispatched
to the city to market, and that Maman had gone with
him. Alas! the little bottle had disappeared; it was no
longer in the niche which could be seen every time the
door was passed. Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; arrived in the afternoon.
By that time some other occult influence had come to
work in Tahara's mind, and directly Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; spoke
to her it was evident that she was hedging. As long
as she was terrified and had lost her head she blurted
out the truth; but given time to think the matter over,
a thousand side-issues weighed with her, and she was
no more inclined to trust us than she would have been
to trust a Moorish woman, who is brought up to lies,
intrigue, and diplomacy, and fed upon such axioms as
"When you have nothing else to tell, tell the truth."
<i>The bottle</i>, she said, <i>had been taken away by S`lam and
his mother. It belonged to his mother. It was poison
to poison people in the Riff.</i> A little later on she said
<i>it had nothing whatever to do with S`lam, and that it
had only water in it&mdash;that S`lam had told her so. That
she had never seen him put anything into her food. That
he was "good." That she only had a bad pain last
night. That she did not know why the bottle had been
brought there.</i> And so on. Her one prayer was that
the signoritas would forget all that had happened. But
for days she would not let us: by creeping up when
S`lam was out of the way and putting her finger on
her lips, by anxious questionings and gesticulations, the
thing was never allowed to rest. She felt, probably, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
she was past one danger&mdash;there was no more to fear
in that direction for the present; but that if her Riffi
husband ever suspected she had "given him away," he
would soon dispose of so troublesome an incubus.</p>

<p>And so we found the matter had come to a deadlock:
more we shall not know. It was typical of the Moors
and their ways. It was, I cannot help thinking, rather
a shady business. Taking into consideration S`lam's
manner towards us for days after, added to those intuitions
which one has and cannot put into words, it struck
us that S`lam himself did not think the bottle had only
water in it.</p>

<p>Ask no questions in this strange land. Lies are the
portion meted out to the inquirer: it is not well to know
too much. "Knowledge and virtue and a horse's mouth
should not pass through too many hands," and "If you
question knowledge, it falls from its estate"&mdash;thus the
Moors.</p>

<p>I shall hear from Miss Z&mdash;&mdash; of Tahara's future welfare,
unless she is moved from Tetuan. If she comes to an
untimely end within the next year or so, our suspicions
were not groundless. For the present we "forget," of
course. For the whole affair&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> times a week, from ten o'clock to twelve
o'clock in the morning, the lady missionaries opened
their dispensary, which, as there was no man missionary
in Tetuan, was in women's hands alone, Miss Banks at
the head. Though, unfortunately, she was not an M.D.
nor a qualified surgeon, the good which she and her
staff did was incalculable. The first day on which the
dispensary was open after R&aacute;madhan over sixty Moors
came to be doctored. The day I went, there were forty-four;
and the two rooms&mdash;one for men, one for women&mdash;were
as full as they would hold, while a large surplus
stood waiting their turn outside. Most of them were of
the lower class of Moors: the better class of women
would ask Miss Banks to visit them in their own
houses; the better class of men would not go to lady
missionaries.</p>

<p>The patients sat round the rooms in a circle. Miss
Banks went to each in turn, and made a note of the
case in a book. This over, she retired to an inner room;
and, among scales, and glass measures, and drugs, and
tins, and bottles by the score, proceeded to make up
all the various medicines. Meanwhile, two others of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
staff took up positions in the middle of the circles of
men and women, and read the Bible to them in Arabic
and talked to them. They seemed to listen attentively,
and one or two nodded occasionally in agreement with
what was said.</p>

<p>Thus, though everybody was doctored and provided
with medicine gratis, they had to sit and listen for a
certain time to Christian views, <i>nolens volens</i>; and this is
the chief opportunity which missionaries have of preaching
to the Mohammedan world.</p>

<p>Many of the patients who had been before brought
medicine-bottles and ointment-boxes to be refilled. If
not, the bottles had to be paid for. In the first instance
they were given in with the medicine; but bottles
are things of great value to the labouring Moor, and
it was found that the people came purely for the sake
of getting them&mdash;once outside the house, the medicine
was thrown away.</p>

<p>One woman paid for her bottle in kind&mdash;four eggs.
Some of the bottles were absurdly small; others the
reverse, for one woman appeared carrying a great earthenware
water-pot standing three feet high.</p>

<p>"My daughter," she said to Miss Banks, "I want
medicine."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I cannot give you medicine in such a
huge pot."</p>

<p>"My daughter, I have been three days on the road,
and I want <i>much</i> medicine."</p>

<p>Another woman, who looked old and decrepit, begged
and prayed that a bottle might be given her. Miss Banks
was adamant. The woman whined and entreated from
ten till half-past eleven: "I am too poor to buy one.
Look at me; I am ill," and so on&mdash;until at last one
of the other missionaries begged Miss Banks to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
her a bottle and send her away. Still she refused
to break her rule. The last patient got up to go.
It was twelve o'clock. The old woman thrust her
hand into the rag round her waist, pulled out a bottle,
and handed it to Miss Banks to be filled.</p>

<p>The cases we saw were numerous. A mother with
two little boys whose heads had to be examined: they
were dispatched with a box of ointment (sulphur and
oil) and a bottle of medicine. A boy with swelled glands
had them painted. A woman had her chest painted, a
man various parts of him. Pills, ointment, powders, etc.,
were distributed, with manifold instructions, repeated again
and again, until the patient's clod-like brain had been
penetrated and set in motion. Even then one would
turn round at the door and say, "Then I am to eat
this ointment?"</p>

<p>A woman was given some salts wrapped in paper,
to be mixed with water and taken the next morning
fasting. She did not come again for a month, and she
brought with her a large earthen pot half full of water
and paper. She had mixed the salts in this with their
wrapping, and had been drinking a mouthful daily, but
felt no better.</p>

<p>Miss Banks gave a woman in good circumstances a
bottle of medicine which was to last her eight days, and
be taken after food; also some liniment for external
use. An urgent summons came two days later: the
woman was dying. "I thought it did me so much good
that last night I took all the rest, and then I drank the
liniment," she said. She recovered.</p>

<p>A man did the same with pills&mdash;was so much pleased
with the effect of one that he devoured the rest all
at once. They invariably ate the paper in which pills or
powders were wrapped.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
On one occasion Miss Banks went to see a girl whom
she was attending, and who seemed worse. The answer,
when asked if she was having her medicine regularly,
was, "Oh no! she's so ill just now. When she's a little
better, we shall give it to her."</p>

<p>Supposing that a patient dies, or a man who has once
been a patient dies, the people have no hesitation in
saying to the missionaries when they meet them in the
street, "Oh! So-and-so's taken your medicine, and it's
killed him."</p>

<p>It is impossible to trust Moors with medicines which
could damage them; this seriously handicaps a doctor:
in extreme cases the dose must be administered by the
doctor personally.</p>

<p>Besides the dispensary, the missionaries had day schools
for the children, night schools for boys, and mothers'
meetings for women. Here, again, the mothers who
attended the meetings were given the material of the
clothes which they made for nothing; but they were
obliged to sit down and listen to a Bible lesson first. It
was one way, it was an opportunity, of bringing Christianity
before Mohammedans.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-31.png"><img src="./images/ill-31_th.png" alt="MOORS AT HOME." title="MOORS AT HOME." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Moors at Home.</p>

<p>Thus through the meetings and the schools and the
dispensary the missionaries knew many of the women
in Tetuan, and there were few houses into which they
had not been at one time or another. Sometimes it
was possible to read to the people in their homes,
sometimes to talk. But with the men they seldom
came in contact. Never with an educated Moor. He
would despise women in general, despise Christianity
past words, and decline to argue on such a point with
a man.</p>

<p>People are apt to forget that Mohammedanism is a faith
to which many millions of earnest and intelligent men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
and women have pinned their salvation. To talk and
argue with these&mdash;it is almost a truism to say&mdash;a missionary
must be "up" in that subject which they have at
their finger-tips&mdash;namely, their religion. This means that
he or she must have a complete knowledge of the Kor&#257;n;
must know the traditions relating to Mohammed and
his companions; must be able to converse about the
divinity and the innumerable saints of Islam; must have
read various religious treatises; and, above and beyond all,
must understand to the smallest point the habits of the
Mohammedan himself, know his life, be able to follow his
thoughts, understand his actions, and be in sympathy with
his recreations as well as with his work, otherwise the
missionary treads on the Mohammedan's toes fifty times
a day, and provokes amusement, mingled with contempt,
of which resentment is born.</p>

<p>Needless to say, few missionaries in Morocco, except
at the end of their life's work, possess these qualifications.
Only a limited number know the Arabic language: they
speak it colloquially of course, but the immense difficulties,
which a thorough knowledge of it entails, debar most of
them from satisfactory study. After years upon years of
hard work, an Arabian scholar frankly avowed to me that
he had but skimmed the surface of the depths of the
Arabic language.</p>

<p>As far as the old idea of missionary work goes&mdash;of
preaching to an attentive throng of Mohammedans and
baptizing converts&mdash;Morocco ranks nowhere. The missionary
who comes out to El Moghreb does incalculable good
in curing the hereditary disease and taint with which an
Eastern nation is rife, and many influence the surrounding
people by the example of a good life and contact with
a civilized mind: he or she is to be profoundly admired
for the determination with which one end and one aim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
are held in view from first to last, and to the furtherance
of which the whole of life is made subservient; and yet
the shadows of disappointment must darken that missionary's
path sometimes, unless he or she is a philosopher.
For we met with none who could point us out a single
convert, openly declaring himself to be one. In Tetuan,
after twelve years' work, there was not one. Two women
there were, who acknowledged to the missionaries, that
they preferred Christianity to Mohammedanism, and who
in private make use of Christian forms of prayer, but
they would not "declare" their belief.</p>

<p>It is said, and no doubt truly, that there would be
many converts to Christianity in Morocco among the
lowest class, if it were not for the persecution of the
Government, and the strong anti-Christian feeling which
exists amongst those in authority. The religion and the
Government are one; the Sultan is the religious head, a
direct descendant from Mohammed; consequently Mohammedanism
is <i>enforced</i>. A woman who declared herself
a Christian would have her children taken from her; a
man would be flogged round the city and boycotted, if
he was not killed. Thus the prospects of the would-be
convert are not happy: all which the missionaries have
to offer him is, on the one hand martyrdom, on the
other a miserable line of compromise&mdash;a life, that is to
say, of concealment and deceit towards those nearest
him, for though Christian at heart, he must yet remain
Mohammedan to the world. This latter course of compromise
is the line which is followed, and it is the course
which is tacitly inculcated by the missionaries. I heard
of no martyrs, nor Christian Moors openly declared, living
in Morocco at peace with mankind.</p>

<p>There is a hitch somewhere. Christianity is in danger
of being dragged in the dust. If it were possible for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
missionaries to make their doctrines appeal to the powerful
and more enlightened class among the Moors, influencing
the country to such an extent that it should adopt
Christianity of its own accord, this could never be so.
But it is not possible. In the present state of Morocco
the idea is laughable. It is hardly to be expected that
the most fanatical and conservative nation ever evolved,
will cast its religion, like a snake its skin, at the bidding
of a body of despised Europeans. Before such a revolution
could take place, the character of such a nation must
entirely change; the Moor must be broadened and given
a scientific training, if he is ever to become of a "progressive"
turn of mind, desiring other ideals than those
of his forefathers.</p>

<p>At the same time the missionary must be adequately
equipped for the fray, must be a "strong man," must
possess some of the qualifications of a leader.</p>

<p>The first point is the all-important one: that more
knowledge should be given to Mohammedans&mdash;scientific
knowledge; that they should be fired to improve their
own condition and that of their country, making themselves
capable of mixing as equals with men who stand
for the highest products of civilization the world so far
knows.</p>

<p>Then, educated and self-educating, their creed, whatever
it is, will be the outcome of their secular training. It
matters little what the belief, so long as the individual
is free as air to adopt it or not at his own discretion.</p>

<p>It would appear, then, that Morocco needs schools,
colleges, and men of unusual calibre to deal with them.
The doctor-missionaries do a vast amount of good; but
it would seem that effort directed in fresh channels should
meet with better results, and that so far there has been
a tendency to "begin at the wrong end."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
It is easy to sit down and criticise; it is easy to map
out new paths, the difficulties connected with which, few
critics can realize. While we see that many of the old
by-ways are tortuous and lead to error, and that many
of them only result in waste of energy, let us at the
same time not forget to give all honour to those who
set out to dig them, for even "defeat, is great."</p>

<p>One afternoon I walked round with Miss Banks, visiting
patients. We started from the Mission House with a
basket of medicines, ointment, thermometer, paint-brush,
etc., and dived into the little, narrow, crowded streets of
countless windowless houses. The first call we paid was
at the house of a Moor in the capacity of "gentleman
farmer": of course he was out. Miss Banks knocked;
there was a movement on the other side, but no answer.
She called through the keyhole, "Anna. Tabiba" (I.
Doctor); and a discreet slave, trained by a jealous and
distrustful master, opened at the sound of her voice.
We walked into a three-cornered, tiled patio: the lady
of the house came to meet us in a pink jellab, shook
Miss Banks's hand and kissed her own, shook mine and
again carried hers to her lips; then led us into a room
opening on to the courtyard, with divans, in white, all
round upon the tiled floor next the wall.</p>

<p>We all three sat down cross-legged on the cushions,
and our hostess related her symptoms to Miss Banks.
She had a bad cough, and seemed glad to have her
chest painted with iodine. She was the daughter of
her husband's cowman; and if, according to English
ideas, somewhat below him in rank, was no worse
educated than the first lady in the land. It is odd
that, while Moors are gentlemen born, their woman-kind,
narrowed and degraded, are in no sense aristocratic.
They will stand upstairs and shout "Come!" to any one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
who is calling upon them and waiting below. "Sit
down," they will say imperatively: it is always the
imperative. If they are asked to show anything, they
will bring it and almost throw it at the visitor's head.
They have no "breeding."</p>

<p>Our hostess was thin, and not at all typical of a
Moorish wife; for a Moor likes a waist which he can
barely clasp with both arms, and women, when they
desire to attract, fatten themselves at once. A woman
who is engaged, is crammed with sweet fattening pills
and farinaceous food.</p>

<p>At one end of the room we sat in, was a gorgeous
four-poster bed, hung with scarlet, and covered with
embroideries, the posts painted bright green, and a great
gilt crown on the top of all. When no furniture is
bought except divans and a bed, all the dollars can
be piled on the bed. We left a bottle of mixture out
of the basket and a doll for the only child, which would
be treasured, for a bunch of rags is the nearest Moorish
approach to a doll.</p>

<p>From this house we went on to our hostess' old home,
where her father, the cowman, lived. The patio there
was cold and bare, and seemed the general living-room;
some wood was stacked in one corner; there was a well
in another; there was an overpowering smell of "drains"
everywhere; while in the third corner a poor, miserable
little girl sat huddled up, with frightened eyes. Several
families lived together in this small house, and no fewer
than six women crowded round the girl to explain her
symptoms to Miss Banks. It was only too apparent
what was wrong, when she uncovered her neck. Syphilis,
hereditary&mdash;a terrible evil, to be found all over Morocco, the
result of Mohammedan customs and bad food. Considering
that women are divorced and remarried over and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
over again, and that the conditions under which they
live are so unhealthy, it is small wonder if disease in
some form or other does not show itself. Examples are
to be met with in almost any street&mdash;the features of the
face obliterated, and so on.</p>

<p>The poor child, whom Miss Banks was treating, had
been married. Now that this disease had broken out,
her husband would probably divorce her. If she were
cured, she might marry again. Her friends had brought
her all the way from Shesaw&#257;n to Tetuan to be cured,
and a Jew doctor had offered to put her right for the
sum of &pound;4.</p>

<p>"But," said her friends, "suppose she dies? What shall
we get for our money then?"</p>

<p>So they sent to the English tabiba, who cures for
nothing.</p>

<p>Miss Banks left ointment and medicine. Cases can be
cured if the patient will persevere long enough with the
medicine; but many of them are too far gone when they
first come.</p>

<p>An old man upstairs in the same house, but of a different
family, claimed her attention next. Three weeks ago he
was perfectly well. He went to a caf&eacute; one evening, drank
a cup of coffee, came home, was seized with pain, and
became completely paralyzed. It pointed to poison, but
he had no enemies.</p>

<p>Mercury is very largely used as a poison, and is given
in different forms. Little is thought of ending life by
this means, unless there happen to be influential relations
who object to their relatives being in this summary
manner "put out of the way."</p>

<p>There is a girl now in Tetuan who keeps a shop.
Her father and mother kept it before her, but she said
that they were both so old, had lived so long, and had had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
their day, that she felt something must be done to secure
her own turn, and that speedily. Therefore she gave them
both some poison. There was a funeral. She took over
the shop.</p>

<p>Another woman was anxious to poison her husband
because he was about to take a second wife. She prepared
him the dish with the poisoned pieces. Suddenly she
saw her child run into the house and join his father at
the meal. Careless of betraying herself, she rushed to her
Benjamin with cries of alarm,&mdash;too late; he had eaten, and
he succumbed that night. The husband died at the end
of a year from the effects of the same poison. Some of
the drugs which Moors use take even longer to destroy
life, but it is only a matter of time. The woman was
put in prison, but she came out after twelve months, and
another man has taken her to wife.</p>

<p>Some missionary and poisoning experiences are amusing.
People often came and asked for poison to administer
to somebody who happened to annoy them.</p>

<p>A slave appeared once and said, "I have a mistress:
she's very old, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the missionary.</p>

<p>"She doesn't enjoy life now much, does she?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think she does much."</p>

<p>"Would she enjoy being with the Lord much more
than living on like this?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the missionary, "she would be far happier
with the Lord."</p>

<p>"Then," said the slave, "give me some poison to send
her to Him."</p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile, Miss Banks looked at her patient, who might
or might not have had his life tampered with; but there
was little she could do then. We left that house and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
walked on into the poorest part of the city, down a little
alley which was hard to find, in search of a certain door
which was still harder. After two or three mistakes, we
hit upon the right one, and knocked at an old, battered,
rat-eaten entrance falling to pieces.</p>

<p>"Anna. Tabiba," called Miss Banks; and the door was
opened by a countryman, a Riffi, rough-looking, only a
coarse jellab over him, but with a kind expression on
his face. The space inside was something like a chicken-pen.
We stooped under a very low doorway in the farther
wall, and went into a little shed-like lean-to, where the
inhabitants evidently lived entirely. A boy of thirteen
was lying on the ground, covered with a piece of sacking.
The father squatted down beside him. Two girls
were grinding beans close to them in a hand-mill&mdash;the
old mill of . . . "the one shall be taken, and the other
left."</p>

<p>Miss Banks and I seated ourselves on a wooden
rail, which was part of a manger or a sheep-pen. These
Riffis had been forced by famine to abandon their home
and come down into Tetuan, where at first they had
lived in a cave, on roots principally. The father would
go out and hoe when he could get work&mdash;every land-owner
has hoeing to be done; but lately he had had
fever. The boy had an abscess, and could not move.
In spite of it he smiled cheerfully, and was delighted
with a new red jellab which Miss Banks brought him.
Poor little chap! he did not live to wear it. I gave
him a trifle to buy food. Beyond the dried beans in
course of being ground, and half a lemon, there was no
sign of anything to eat. Beans and lemons to fight an
abscess!</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-32.png"><img src="./images/ill-32_th.png" alt="STRAW FOR SALE." title="STRAW FOR SALE." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Straw for Sale.</p>

<p>After Miss Banks had attended to the child, we took
our way to the house of a Moorish doctor, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
been unable to cure himself, and had sent in desperation
for his European rival.</p>

<p>He was lying on a divan upstairs, himself the colour
of oatmeal porridge, with his wife attending to him; and
he had a terrible sore on his thigh. This was duly
attended to. The long fast of R&aacute;madhan might partly
account for his state of health. In spite of his faith in
Miss Banks, which he would sooner have died than acknowledged,
he had unbounded confidence in his own
skill as a doctor.</p>

<p>We asked him if he could read.</p>

<p>"Read? No. Why should he read? What was the
use of reading? The thing you wanted to do was to
<i>remember</i>. Now he, if he was doctoring any one, he
would try first this herb and then that. This herb no
good. Try another. Another no good. Another no
good. He might try twelve herbs, and all no good.
And the thirteenth herb would be good. And then he
would <i>remember</i> that herb. Why! all his doctoring he
taught himself . . ."</p>

<p>A rough sort of doctoring it is too, consisting of two
remedies&mdash;a violent purge, or else burning with a hot
iron. Every sore place is burnt; and for all sorts of
illnesses, in cases of rheumatism, etc., etc., the patient is
scored, perhaps all over his chest or back&mdash;"fired" like
a horse. Sores are always cauterized. Bullets are never
extracted. Wounds are bound up with earth and rags.
A serious gunshot wound, means death. Certainly there
is a wide field for women doctors in Morocco.</p>

<p>From this house we went on to one where the father,
mother, and children were all having a meal&mdash;a poverty-stricken
family again, where one of the children was
wasting away with fever. The rest of the party were
sitting round an earthenware pan, which was full of mallow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
leaves, stewed in native oil, with red pepper and garlic
in huge quantities. They were dipping in their fingers,
fishing out the greasy mallow and garlic, and laying it
on their brown native bread and eating it. They insisted
upon our joining them. It is no excuse to say "I have
dined lately," for a Moor eats at any time, when there
happens to be food. Miss Banks tasted the stew with a
heroism worthy the noblest end.</p>

<p>We went on to the house of a man who has one of
the best shops in Tetuan. It was consequently comfortable,
and delightfully fresh-looking. The master of the
house was in bed with fever&mdash;that is to say, we found him
reclining on a divan on the floor, beside a gorgeous bed,
with a lily-white turban fresh from the wash-tub wound
round his head. We sat down on the divan running round
the room, and Miss Banks was glad to hear that her
patient had at last consented to take quinine. He was
worn-looking, with small black beard and moustache.
Moors, like every effete people, are unable to grow a great
quantity of hair on their faces.</p>

<p>After visiting her cases Miss Banks suggested something
of a change, and we turned into the best part of Tetuan,
to pay a call upon one of the first families in Morocco, the
head of which is now dead. B&mdash;&mdash; was probably the most
wealthy and enlightened Moor in the city: he was once
employed by Government, and he made his little pile;
but he had never married&mdash;or, rather, his only marriage
had ended in a speedy divorce; and most of his life he
had been able to afford to keep a galaxy of slaves, whom
he had freed in time, and whose offspring represent the
family to-day.</p>

<p>The name of the chief of his slaves, and the mistress
of the dead man's house at the present moment, is Fatima.
Fatima has a history. B&mdash;&mdash; possessed twenty white slaves:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
they were chiefly stolen from villages in the south, and
they passed into his hands; but his treasures were two
beautiful Circassian women from Turkey, one of whom
he sent to the late Sultan (who is the mother of the
present Sultan), the other he kept for himself&mdash;Fatima.
Fatima early showed a disposition far from humble, and
B&mdash;&mdash; spoilt her. At last he made her head of his house
and all his slaves. One day she caused two of these
women to be beaten in such a manner that one of them
died. The other vowed revenge; went to B&mdash;&mdash;, and
told him that she had seen Fatima looking through a
window at a man in the garden below. Considering that
a woman of superior class must not look out of her
window, though the prospect be an arid yard, the statement
was calculated to rouse B&mdash;&mdash;. Brought up on such
proverbs as "When the bee hums and the buttermilk
ferments, place, O brother, a halter on thy little daughter,"
and to consider women "the nearest roads to hell," B&mdash;&mdash;
took prompt and drastic measures. He chained Fatima
up to a pillar for three months, and fed her on bread and
water. Her eldest daughter was to be married. Fatima
was released and told she might attend the wedding, but
only as the equal of the lowest slave, and dressed as such.
She said that she had been accustomed to mixing with
the first-born of Tetuan as an equal, and she would go
among them as nothing else. To break Fatima's pride,
B&mdash;&mdash; married a wife; but the wiles of his old favourite
were too strong for him, and he gave her presents,
including a gold bracelet. The indignant wife, furious
at her husband's attentions to a mere slave, got a divorce
and left B&mdash;&mdash;; whereupon he fell into the arms of
Fatima, and she graciously consented to become once
more head of his house. She is now the proudest
woman in Tetuan, inclined to look upon the missionaries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
and European women in general as dust under her feet.
Her ignorance is unbounded. "India!" she said to Miss
Hubbard. "You say all India belongs to you English.
You may well wish it did. You've only got one
port."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we had reached the door of this famous
lady's house, and were clanging the great knocker. It
was superior to any door we had "wakened" that afternoon&mdash;made
of pale, cinnamon-coloured wood, and immensely
wide, carved up above and brightened with
great fork-like hinges and nail-heads as large as pennies.
A vastly stout slave, smart in proportion, opened the
door, and said something in Arabic to Miss Banks, which,
translated, intimated that a large tea party was going on
within. She led us along far-reaching, wide passages,
which at length opened out into an extensive patio, paved
with great black and white marble tiles, like a giant chess-board.
A double row of finely tiled pillars supported
the roof, and a fountain shot up water in the centre of
all. The style of the building suggested that the dead
man had known how to spend some of his money, and
to make for himself a place refined and romantic rather
than gorgeous.</p>

<p>Stepping down the cool aisles between the pillars, the
slave took us towards a room opening out of the patio;
and such a room!&mdash;hung with embroideries, surrounded
with luxurious divans worked in scarlet and white, carpeted
with deep-piled carpets, and yet no more than
a mere setting for the fantastic butterfly world which
seemed let loose inside. Tetuan's most aristocratic women,
scented favourites of Moorish society, kept in lavender
and reared on sugar and orange-flower water, are not
among those things which one easily forgets. About
twelve of them or more&mdash;enough to dazzle and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>
bewilder, furnish to perfection yet avoid a crush&mdash;were
half reclining on the divans round the room. Fatima
was on our immediate left as we entered; a holy
Shar&#299;fa on the right; the daughter of another Shar&#299;f
sat beyond her. The circle was one of Sanctity and
Rank.</p>

<p>We shook hands with the mistress of the house, and
were motioned to take our seats on the divan exactly
opposite her.</p>

<p>Fatima was no disappointment. She suggested much,
and more than fulfilled the promise of her history. She
was pale and dark, with a little head like a snake's,
thin sarcastic lips, and eyes full of smouldering devil.
Two silver trays stood in front of her, covered with
fragile porcelain cups and thin gilded cut-glass, with a
silver-topped box full of fragrant mint, another quaint
box containing fine green tea, an enormous cut-glass
sugar-basin heaped with small rocks of white sugar,
two silver embossed and steaming teapots, some scent-sprinklers
and incense-burners of silver. At her elbow, on
the floor, was the largest silver urn I ever saw, capable of
supplying half a dozen school feasts; down the room, in
a line, upon the carpets, stood round baskets, three feet in
diameter, filled with palest cream-coloured bracelet-shaped
loaves of bread, made of too fine and white a flour and
too perfectly baked for any but the upper ten to indulge
in. The centre basket contained perhaps fifty cakes&mdash;nothing
on a small scale here&mdash;made of thin flaked pastry,
iced over with sugar, filled with a confectionery of
almonds, and quinces, and raisins, and orange-flower
water, and an essence, one drop of which cost five
shillings. These take a day to make, and are only
met with in an elaborate <i>m&eacute;nage</i>. Other tarts, lavishly
coated with a snow of white sugar, contained jams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
and nuts and all the sweet things dear to the Moorish
heart.</p>

<p>The movements of Fatima's small hands among the
cups, covered with rings, each polished nail just touched
with a half-moon of dark red henna, were born of <i>dolce
far niente</i>, backed by a long line famous for their beauty:
her restless black eyes alternately gleamed with cruelty
and cunning; flashed with passion; grew sad as it is given
to few eyes to grow.</p>

<p>Many embroidered buttons, as edgings in front, betokened
garment within garment, which she wore, all of
them at last confined by a broad, richly worked belt; her
kaftan was of lemon-yellow, shining with silver borderings;
the muslin "overall" was the thinnest atmosphere of white;
there were many necklaces, chiefly pearl, round her neck,
and, most characteristic of all, a tiny yellow silk handkerchief
was knotted once round her throat; on her
black head, colour ran riot in silks of all shades, tied
and twisted and arranged as only a Moorish hand
knows; her feet were wrapped in a soft pale yellow
shawl, embroidered. She did not get up when we
came in.</p>

<p>Multiply Fatima twelve times, in colours more opulent
and more bizarre than her own, instead of her lithe
figure, picture stone upon stone of sleek flesh, and some
idea of the epicureanism of the scene is arrived at.
Sitting on each side of us were two of the fattest women
I have ever seen.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-33.png"><img src="./images/ill-33_th.png" alt="A GROUP IN THE FEDDAN, TETUAN." title="A GROUP IN THE FEDDAN, TETUAN." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">A Group in the Feddan, Tetuan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fatima signed to a slave to carry across the
cups of tea which she had poured out, together with thin
china plates; then we were supplied with the fine sweet
bread. Miss Banks explained that I was not a <i>tabiba</i>
(doctor). Fatima told her I was to ask about anything
which I did not understand, and with interpretations we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>
carried on trifling conversation. It was like stepping into
"The Arabian Nights" come to life. These women seldom
go out of doors, or, if they do, nothing is to be seen of them
except a figure in an immense creamy woollen haik from
top to toe, heavily veiled: possibly a pair of haunting
eyes and beautiful slippers suggest an attractive "beyond."
But here were we "i' the centre of the labyrinth," where
mere men can never go; in a maze of hot imperious
colour; in a world of ivory-tinted faces, flowing lines,
and stately gestures; among <i>abandon</i> such as one little
dreams of in a Mohammedan double-locked world.</p>

<p>They lie at the ends of the pole, the women of
Morocco: the countrywomen, beasts of burden; the
wives of the rich, sumptuously fed and caparisoned
lap-dogs.</p>

<p>Amidst such a show of silk and embroidery no English-woman,
in the utilitarian coat and skirt best fitted for
travel, could feel other than out of place, nor resist the
weak desire that the imperious Fatima and her circle
should have another impression of our countrywomen
made upon their ignorant minds than that given by
short skirts and nailed boots&mdash;say, Covent Garden one
night when the opera has drawn all the diamonds in
town.</p>

<p>I remember the Moorish French Consul, in the
Tetuan post-office, saw R. writing a card in there
once.</p>

<p>"What a great thing it is," he said to Mr. Bewicke,
"that your women can write and can arrange things for
themselves. I go away; my wife cannot write to me.
Our women are just like animals."</p>

<p>As far as I could gather, a Moorish woman does not
think for herself until she is divorced. Her father, mother,
or brother marries her to whomsoever he or she chooses;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
but when once she is divorced, she is free to marry
after her own heart, and no one can interfere with her.
Divorce was of course allowed by Mohammed. It is
so common that no wife is surprised at being divorced
a year after marriage, or six months, even a week. If
she does not get up in time in the morning, her husband
can divorce her, or if she becomes ill, or for a hundred
petty reasons. Therefore upon the marriage-lines is
always entered the sum of money which a wife brings
her husband; a poor woman will bring from thirty
shillings to three pounds, a rich woman from a hundred
to three hundred pounds; and whatever the sum be, the
husband must refund it to the wife when he divorces
her. The actual getting of the divorce is simplicity itself.
Man and wife go before the deputy of the governor of
the city or province and state their case. The deputy
will probably say, "Very well. Pay the woman such-and-such
a sum mentioned in the agreement, and go your
several ways."</p>

<p>A man, however, often changes his mind, and marries
the woman whom he has divorced; and perhaps they
are divorced a second time and married a third time.
But he may not marry her the third time unless she
has meanwhile been married by another man and divorced
from him.</p>

<p>Many of the Moorish husbands leave their wives&mdash;the
Riffis, for instance, going back into the Riff. If they are
away over a year and send no money to the wife,
she can claim a divorce: going before the deputy
with a witness or two, it is soon arranged; she then
probably marries a second husband. Were it not for
this arrangement, Tetuan would be full of deserted
wives.</p>

<p>It must be most difficult to try to "preach" either to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>
the men or women. The men would not have it. I
knew one missionary who used to sit in their shops
and talk to them, but directly he veered round within a
point of "religion" that talk was over. The women
were less difficult in that respect; they would discuss
the point: one woman I heard say something as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should I turn a Christian? See&mdash;I may steal,
I may lie, I may commit murder; my sins may reach as
high as from earth to heaven, and at the day of my
death <i>God is merciful</i>. He will forgive me all, because
I witness to Mohammed as his Prophet. Your religion
is a narrow little religion; mine covers everything. You
go home and go away by yourself and <i>witness to
Mohammed</i> as his Prophet, and all your sins will be
forgiven."</p>

<p>It is a sign of their being low down in the intellectual
scale when the members of society talk for the
most part of "persons," just as it is a sign of a higher
tone when the conversation runs chiefly upon "ideas."
Among the women at Fatima's tea party there was no
sort or kind of exchange of thought of any description,
nor was there general conversation. They talked in a
desultory way to each other about their children, their
clothes, their food, their money, and each other&mdash;sometimes
they included Miss Banks, but never touched an
interesting point.</p>

<p>If a woman unable to read or write only meets
women also unable to read or write, and knows but
one man, her husband, who feeds her and values her
much like a tame doe-rabbit, it is unreasonable to
expect to find in her much intelligence and energy.
Wives, when asked if they did not wish to do more,
would not like to read or write or work, only laughed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
derisively. The idea was absurd: they could not understand
any one wishing to exert herself in a novel and
unnecessary way.</p>

<p>On my left, still sat the stoutest woman in the room&mdash;the
holy Shar&#299;fa. She lost her snuff-box, and roused
herself to hunt all over her enormous person for it&mdash;a
work of time; but a friend had borrowed it, and it
was passed back to her. She sat on the divan, cross-legged
like some gigantic idol of ancient Egypt, many
yards in circumference at the base, her fat little hands
folded across the embroideries and gold-worked buttons
and worked edges of the many gorgeous waistcoats and
kaftans, which seemed piled one on top of each other
on her immense frame. Her head, the size of two footballs
rolled into one, was swathed in violet and scarlet
silk: straight whiskers of hair, dyed jet-black, were
combed a few inches down each cheek, and then cut
short. The whole "idol" sat very still, speaking but
rarely, and then in a harsh croak like some oracular and
forbidding bird: "it" had the appearance of being comfortably
gorged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fatima signed or murmured to the slaves,
and the sweetmeats were carried round, and the fragile
cups refilled; and there went up a great aroma of sweet
mint tea.</p>

<p>Through the wide doorway the patio and its colonnades
of many pillars lay cool and shaded; cages of singing
canary-birds hung from the ceiling; the fountain rippled
in the middle; a tall girl in green and white sauntered
across in her slippered feet, carrying a tray; a gaily
dressed slave passed silently; and the whole thing might
have been a dream. . . .</p>

<p>Past the patio lay the courtyard, all one large garden,
with tiled walks and red-gold oranges and heavy foliage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
set against the blue sky. Broad date-palms, mimosa, and
climbing creepers sometimes shook in a breath of wind.
The clear tanks, full of ever-running water and lined with
maiden-hair fern, moved with gold-fish, which matched
the oranges; a pet monkey played amongst the lemons
on a lemon-tree; a green parrot nodded to us from a
bower of pink almond blossom.</p>

<p>We wandered round the sleepy, silent courtyard, and
in and out the chequered greenery, hot with windless,
sun-filled air, back through the black-and-white courts,
until at last the great outside door shut upon Fatima,
her tea party, and the eternal mysticism of the East:&mdash;we
were without the gates of Paradise, and in an atmosphere
of rude realism once more.</p>

<p>Soon after that afternoon of many calls with Miss
Banks, a day up in the Anjera Hills, to the north of
Tetuan, gave some idea of the strip of country which
lay between us, and the sea, and Gibraltar. This country
possessed the fascination of being little known. No one
troubled to go up there, except its own wild inhabitants.
Our own Consul had never been. The missionaries had
not climbed so high, nor so far, this side the river.</p>

<p>Now the Tetuan <i>sok</i> (market) is greatly dependent
upon the country people belonging to the Beni Salam
tribe, who live up in the Anjeras; and from the flat white
roof of our garden-house we had watched through a
pair of glasses on market mornings, strings of women,
winding by a precipitous path down the hillside, which
is abrupt and mountainous, themselves dropping as it
were from an upper world. They scrambled slowly
down, one after the other, descending many hundreds
upon hundreds of feet; then filed slantwise over the
slopes, right into the rocky Mussulman cemetery, across
that, and thence into the city by the B&aacute;b-el-M`kabar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>
The relations of these tribesmen between themselves and
the city are more or less friendly, and it is comparatively
safe to wander about the mountains as long as the
"enemy," as the Moors call the sun, has not set. We
were most anxious to visit the country whence these
market-goers came, appearing first upon the crest-line,
then against the rough hillside, like a string of industrious
white ants crawling down the wall of a house; therefore
we engaged a youth with a downy beard and hairy legs
and the big grey donkey&mdash;the most active of his race&mdash;and
set off one morning at half-past nine, prepared to
climb into a Top World, like Jack of the Beanstalk, by
means of a path which was less smooth "going" than
his supernatural ladder.</p>

<p>There was a strong north-west wind, and it was hardly
an occasion for "aloft"; but there was no haze; the
clouds were scudding away to South Australia; it was
a day for a view.</p>

<p>Taking the broken road towards the city, we branched
off to the right, crossed a stream, and began the ascent.
No one could ride at this point. R. tried a tow
by means of the donkey's tail, and met with a remonstrating
kick. Certainly, if this could be called "one
of the Sultan's highways," it was an odd specimen. We
scrambled up the east side of the range of hills, sometimes
by a succession of rocky staircases, sometimes
sliding (backwards chiefly) on loose shale: how the
donkey contrived to look after its four feet must remain
a problem, but the Morocco ass is brought up from
birth upon stony ground, with na&iuml;ve and simple notions
upon the subject of paths.</p>

<p>It was a long time before our heads showed up above
the top of Jack's Beanstalk (so to speak), and we met
with a gale, at which the donkey's hair stood on end,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
and which occupied all our attention for a minute. We
had seen Tetuan disappear far below us behind the
elbow of a hill; the topmost point of the Gib. Rock
had loomed into sight; Ceuta looked as if one might
have thrown a stone upon it; and the Riff Mountains
were next door, clear and blue. We had passed some
red fritillaries and the bee-orchid, a little wild mauve
crocus, and some magnificent clumps of white heath,
which smelt of almonds and honey; had seen several
pairs of stone-chats with their white collars; had sat
down for many "breathers"; and at last were at the
top, in a wind which flattened every palmetto-bush plumb
against the hillside. It was a breezy spot for riding
(and here one <i>could</i> ride, for the grey donkey was on <i>terra
firma</i> once more); therefore we cut short a survey of the
country below us, hurried off the crest-line, and followed
the path which led straight away into the heart of the
Anjera country. It was a good track when once the
top had been reached, exactly the right width for one
individual, and used by thirty or forty every market
day&mdash;three times a week. At the time when the cave-men
lived in England, <i>single file</i> was a standing principle
in Morocco, and the practice still holds good.</p>

<p>The path was beaten hard, by bare feet, in the rich
dark red soil, and had taken a shiny polish; the wind
was held off us by boulders and small hillocks; we got
along at a steady pace. On each side mountains and
only mountains were to be seen, peak beyond peak, slope
after slope, covered with short wind-tossed scrub and
sharp, hard rock, except at any great height or in the
prevailing wind; there ledge after ledge lay peeled by
the weather, blistering in the sun, the scarified faces of
the cliffs worn at the summits into pinnacles of gaunt
stone. No mark of humanity, except the single red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
path, suggested that civilization ever troubled these heights,
and there was hardly anything worth the notice of a goat
in the shape of fodder.</p>

<p>The path rose and fell, skirting now this shoulder
and now a gully, but keeping for the most part on high
ground, here and there winding upwards across the sharp
spine of a ridge, and, by way of some awkward staircase,
once more landing us on the level. More often
than not, the donkey had only himself to carry; the
boy probably thought us mad, but there was no understanding
what the other would fain have said. Except
for the wind&mdash;and even that dropped&mdash;a great silence lay
on the proud heights; they defied man to interfere with
their grizzled <i>d&eacute;bris</i>: the birds had forgotten to sing:
all around was that certain awed solemnity, always to
be found, in the companionship of the everlasting hills.
But the air was champagne; the heather was mad
in the breeze; the sky where it met the rocks, an
intoxicating blue. And how the clouds "travelled"!
Though, in spite of that, the hills never spoke: like
the Sphinx, whose repose no dance of lizards nor flashes
of sunlight can disturb, they are "too great to appease,
too high to appal, too far to call." Occasionally a dip
in the hollow back of a mountain showed the sea beyond:
there are few seas bluer than the blue Mediterranean can
be, and this was one of its days.</p>

<p>The polished track led us on: still no sign of
a village, nor any evidences of civilization. At last
from the top of a ridge we looked over and down into
a calm green oasis, "a lodge in some vast wilderness,"
secluded, sheltered, where it would have been good to
pitch a tent and camp for many moons. We swung
along downwards, dropped under the lee of the hill, and
our path skirted the fringe of the green oasis. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>
was not many acres in extent; it was covered with
short scant grass; it would have made an ideal polo-ground.</p>

<p>Water lay over a small corner of it, and beyond a
shadow of doubt it had once been the bottom of a
lake; indeed, the Beni Salam tribe believe that water still
lies underneath the turf. Here the first sign of humanity
showed itself: two goatherds drove their flock down
to the water, and one of them carried in the hood
of his brown jellab a few hours' old kid; they soon
passed on and disappeared among the boulders and
heath.</p>

<p>The long level lines of the green oasis were broken
at the edge by diminutive bones of rock protruding
through the grass. Sunk in the hollow of the hills, there
was little or no wind; the sun glowed indolently down
on the green lawn, tempting us to stay; but the foot-prints
in the red soil pointed forward, and we turned
our backs upon the flat stretches of sunny turf and left
the waveless tarn behind.</p>

<p>No more emerald oasis, but grey-green scrub and
stones on the mountain-sides: we were up again in a
stern and desolate defile, waste beyond waste strewn
with rocks. The distances were oddly deceptive in the
rare, clear air: a saddle between two peaks looked
miles away&mdash;we were upon it in half an hour; again,
a turret of rock apparently within a stone's-throw was
a weary climb. And still the red trail snaked on
before us. Even the big grey donkey began to lose
its interest and to require "encouragement" from the
Moorish boy.</p>

<p>We speculated as to whether we should ever reach a
village before it was time to make tracks for the world
below, while the sun was well up. At last, in front of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
us, a long low saddle intervened, with rising ground on
each side: this we determined to scale, once mounted
on top see all there was to be seen, and go no
farther. And toil brought its unexpected and exceeding
great reward. Standing on the crest-line, shading
our eyes with our hands, mountain beyond mountain
lay in the distance&mdash;the Anjeras, the hills of Spain, the
Mediterranean, Gibraltar; while in the foreground clustered
four villages, brown mud-coloured huts upon the
brownish slopes, and only picked out of their surroundings
by means of the one little whitewashed spot of a
mosque. Below us a river had carved a gorge in the
red soil and tumbled over worn boulders beside the
nearest village, but it was more or less hidden from
sight.</p>

<p>Much as we wanted to go on, it was impossible.
First, there was not time. Secondly, the donkey would
have had as much as was good for him by the time he
got back. Therefore we chose a warm, sheltered spot,
backed by sun-baked rocks and scented with cropped
tussocks of yellow gorse; and there we lunched, the
boy and donkey slipping out of sight, and leaving us
alone, with the hills, and the sound of the wind.</p>

<p>It must be a long tramp into Tetuan, even for hill
people born to the life of the open road,&mdash;four hours
into the city with heavy loads of charcoal, faggots,
chickens, eggs, butter, vegetables; four hours back again
with oil, sugar, salt, tea, and every sort of necessary
which is not home grown. And three times a week.
And only women. We met a string of them as we set
our faces homewards, like "toiling cattle straining across
a thousand hills"; but they all had a word to say and a
smile, as they sloped along at a steady swing.</p>

<p>The sun was setting when we left the good upper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
world of silence and the winds; by-and-by the crest-line
intervened between ourselves and the strong serene
heights&mdash;they were seen no more; and we came "hand
over hand down the Beanstalk" which led to the white
city below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the month of April, Morocco takes its head
from under its wing; the bad weather turns its
back on the country; the tracks dry up and are fit for
travellers to take to once more. The time had come
for the sake of which we had borne with the rains, and
we longed to be off, to know something more of this
strange and fascinating land.</p>

<p>May is a better month than April, up in the north,
for travelling; April is often dashed with the tail-end of
the rains; but our desire was to go down into the
far south, and May and June in the south are both too
hot to enjoy camping out. April is quite warm enough;
indeed, Morocco City "stokes up" early in April;
therefore we made it the middle of March when we said
good-bye to Jinan Dolero and set our faces Tangier-wards,
there to await some steamer which should take
us down the coast. The odds and ends which had
furnished us at Tetuan and were not wanted had to be
sold&mdash;a very simple matter. The day before we left
our white garden-house, S`lam and some <i>mesdames</i>, as
in his best French he always spoke to us of his ragged
countrywomen, carried them into the sok, as they were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
on their backs; and they were sold to the highest bidder
among the market-goers.</p>

<p>To transport ourselves and our belongings over to
Tangier, a Jew muleteer was requisitioned, who provided
men and mules for the two days' journey. After long
consultations we decided to take S`lam with us on
our travels in the capacity of personal servant and head
cook&mdash;partly because he could cook, partly because, in
spite of the Tahara-and-bottle-of-water-or-poison episode,
we liked him, and he had been a good servant according
to his lights. After all, he was probably as trustworthy,
and more so, than any man we could pick up in a hurry
down south&mdash;at least, everybody warned us that they
were a set of rascals there, of whom we were to beware.
Finally, he was used to us and we were used to him.
So S`lam set out with our cavalcade, and we proposed
to keep him while we were at Tangier, take him by
boat to Mogador, and after our march was over return
him to Tetuan. But, while "man proposes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was sorry for Tahara. She was left behind with her
old enemy&mdash;S`lam's mother. He left the mother money,
but Tahara not one flus. He said, too, that when he
came back from Morocco City he should go straight off
to the Riff and get work there; and Tahara would be
left again. Such is the custom of the country: the
husband may go off for a year, at intervals returning
to his wife, whom he leaves generally under some sort
of supervision. So poor little Tahara, who had no voice
in her marriage, but had wept all the way to Tetuan under
the escort of her bridegroom and brother, was left penniless
in the old mother's clutches. She had no relatives near
to help her, otherwise I have no doubt that she would
have got a divorce. We could only ask Z&mdash;&mdash; to keep
an eye on her, for interference in the Moorish domestic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
hearth on the part of a European would be a fool's work
indeed.</p>

<p>It was March 19 when we began to wander once
more, having handed the keys of Jinan Dolero back
to its owner and cleared out the little white house.
Unfortunately we pitched on the <i>Aid-el-Kebeer</i> (the
Great Feast), starting the very day before it was
due; and, in consequence of the Mohammedan-World
being upside-down with joyful anticipation, could get no
good mules, nor induce any one but a Jew to leave
Tetuan at such a time. S`lam looked forward to feasting
with his brother at Tangier, and started off with a
good grace. A more serious miss than either Moorish
servants or reliable mounts was perhaps a tent. There
was none to be had in Tetuan at just that time, and a
night had to be passed upon the way. However, there
was no help for it: we set off as we were, and arrived
towards sunset at the half-way caravanserai, the little
white-walled fond&acirc;k on the top of the hills, where we
passed such a windy night, on our way over from
Tangier in December, under canvas.</p>

<p>It was a good ride, and our mules travelled badly:
saddles and bridles were tumbling to pieces too. For
the last mile or so we both walked and sent the
baggage on ahead. From a bend round the crest of
a hill we said farewell to an uneven white streak set
at the foot of the distant hills&mdash;Tetuan&mdash;and saw it no
more. The fond&acirc;k was in front of us, four lonely walls
exposed to every change of weather, and no life stirring
outside. We walked through the arched gateway into
the square, which is surrounded with Norman arches, and
found a company of mules and donkeys, of owners and
drivers, taking shelter for the night: our own baggage
animals were already hobbled in a line in front of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
arches, under which the muleteers sit, and drink, and
smoke, and sleep the hours away, till the first streak of
dawn.</p>

<p>We scrambled up an uneven stone staircase at the
corner of the square, and investigated the two little
rooms at the disposal of travellers. One look: there
were suggestions of the insect world in both. We recrossed
the thresholds and sought further: the flat white
roof above the arches round the square, if windswept,
was too airy to be anything but fresh and wholesome,&mdash;it
should meet all our demands. Here then, out in
the open, under the sky, our two beds were arranged,
in the lee of a few yards of parapet which had been
built to shelter the west corner of the roof. S`lam had
a small pan of charcoal also up on the roof in our
corner, over which to get something hot for us to eat;
and as soon as the odd little meal was finished we
turned in.</p>

<p>The precipitous twilight had shadowed down sufficiently
to undress in more or less privacy even upon
a housetop; over our beds we spread a thin woollen
carpet to keep off the dew; the moon, which was beginning
its last quarter, faced us full, in a sky picked
out with a few stars, against which the dark outline
of the hills was cut clear; there was hardly a
fleck of cloud in that best roof under which a man
can sleep.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-34.png"><img src="./images/ill-34_th.png" alt="A BREEZY CAMPING-GROUND ON A ROOF-TOP." title="A BREEZY CAMPING-GROUND ON A ROOF-TOP." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">A Breezy Camping-Ground on a Roof-Top.</p>

<p>Below, down in the square, the picketed mules
stamped and munched barley; the muleteers' voices,
back under the arches in the colonnade, arose and fell,
round a fire where green tea was brewing and much
kif was in course of being smoked; occasionally an owl
hooted. Waking from time to time, the moon was always
staring down (I shall never forget that moon); but at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>
each interval it had moved <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'farthur'">farther</ins> round overhead. At
last it sank behind the field of vision, and up "in that
inverted bowl we call the sky" the remote and passionless
stars had it all to themselves.</p>

<p>About half-past three in the morning we were awakened
suddenly by the patter of rain on our faces, great single
drops, which quickened into a hurrying shower; while
gusts of wind from the south-west rose and swept round
the corner of the low parapet against which we had put
the heads of the beds. One glance showed that the
sky was overcast; it was very dark, most of the stars
were hidden, and there was an ominous sound of rain in
the wind. The fond&acirc;k is notably a wet resting-place,
for it lies on the top of the watershed which divides the
plains of Tetuan and Tangier, and it draws the clouds
like a magnet.</p>

<p>One of us put up a sun-umbrella, which had been useful
on the hot ride the day before; it kept an end of one bed
more or less dry, and fortunately the shower did not last
long, while underneath warm bedding it was possible to
keep dry for a time. The wind rose, however, and forced
itself in at every fold of the bedclothes. We had carefully
arranged all our kit under the parapet close to the beds,
partly to prevent its being stolen, which sometimes happens
if left out of the owner's reach, partly to prevent its rolling
or blowing off the unprotected edge of the roof.</p>

<p>The sunset of the night before had not foretold wind;
but wind there began rapidly to be, and by-and-by the
lid of one of our cooking-pots bowled along the roof,
fell over the edge, and rattled on the stones in the square
below: a cloth belonging to the cuisine took flight next
over the outer wall, and was seen no more. We lay
speculating on what might follow. Then another shower
began; but the clouds were lifting a little, and it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[<a href="./images/256.png">256</a>]</span>
short if it was sharp; while underneath the blankets there
was not much to complain of.</p>

<p>At four o'clock a sound of life began down below;
the muleteers were all up and stirring in the square.
Lights were lit, for since the moon and stars had been
obscured, the night had turned from brilliant light into
one of shadows and blackness. Was there to be more
rain? Nothing else mattered. In this fine interval&mdash;for
the last shower was stopping&mdash;it seemed wise to get
up and dress and have our bedding rolled together:
neither of us was going to move into the rooms. Certainly
dressing was a chilly opportunity. The evening before
had been warm; but the rain freshened the air, and the
wind made it still more brisk. It was darker than ever&mdash;too
windy to have kept a light going; and clothes,
discovered with some difficulty in the shadows in hiding-places
under rugs and pillows where they had been
stowed the evening before to escape the dew, were hurried
into in the dark anyhow and any way, half blown inside-out
in the wind.</p>

<p>At half-past four S`lam came up on to the roof-top
with a light (which was promptly extinguished) and a
pail of cold fresh water, in which we had an acceptable
wash. He rolled up our bedding, and brought an earthenware
pan of burning charcoal, which was stowed away in
a corner of the stone stairway out of the wind, and on
which the kettle soon began to boil. At this point two
remaining stars were put out by the advancing dawn&mdash;a
wan and shivering dawn. Sitting in the lee of the
parapet, five o'clock saw us ready, and supplied with
hot tea and eggs. Not long after, the rain-clouds blew
over and the day broke clear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the muleteers had loaded up and vanished
with the first streak of daylight, in order to be in Tetuan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
in time for the great feast that day; the inner square
of the caravanserai was deserted; our own five mules
were all that was left. It was not a long business loading
them: the last rope was knotted, and the muleteers drove
them off. We followed, riding out under the gateway,
whereon is written in Arabic a sentence to the effect that
Mulai Abdurrahman built the fond&acirc;k in 1256, according
to Mohammedan reckoning of time.</p>

<p>The sky was grey and menacing: too many of the
little single clouds called "wet dogs" drifted across it.
Having started at half-past five, not till three o'clock
that afternoon did we reach Tangier; halting once on
the march, at ten o'clock, and that only for half an
hour for lunch. A heavy storm cut that halt short,
for the rest of the day the "wet dogs" were true to
themselves, and we were deluged. Vivid lightning flashed
and cracking peals of thunder rolled over the plain; it
was one of those March days which make March no
month for camping out in Northern Morocco. Added to
that, the track was in a shocking state&mdash;up to the girths
in mud and water and clay of a sticky and treacherous
nature. The mules slipped back at every step. We
had many small rivulets to cross, and were obliged to
make great detours in order to circumvent them at all.
Even then our baggage was in the greatest peril, for the
mules could barely keep their feet; and once down in
some of the deepest quagmires, there would have been
the utmost difficulty in getting them up again, or in
rescuing our unfortunate kit. And the rain came
through everything, bedding and all being fairly drenched.
The mules which carried the baggage were of course
much the best of our beasts: R.'s and my mounts
were indeed sorry for themselves. The last hour was
the darkest, during which R.'s mule fell down for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
sixth or seventh time&mdash;it was slippery and rough&mdash;and
we had the worst piece of country of all to cross, where
we found one unfortunate mule bogged in a sort of mud
stream. Though a soaking does not greatly signify when
dry clothes and a roof lie at the journey's end, nine hours
at a foot's pace, through mud and water, wet and weary,
will take the heart out of most people. We tailed into
Tangier, a dilapidated, worn string of bedraggled vagrants,
and rode to the Continental. An hour later, clean and
dry, in comfortable chairs, with hot coffee, there was
content.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, S`lam was not at all fulfilling our expectations;
and since we left the fond&acirc;k, far from distinguishing
himself on the march, he failed over and over again to
rise to the occasion, excellent servant though he had
been in the garden-house near his own city. While
the muleteers walked all the way from Tetuan, driving
the baggage-mules and urging on our own, S`lam by
arrangement rode on the top of a light load; and there
he sat, huddled up on the mule, wet and discontented,
dawdling behind, last of all, in the cavalcade, and anything
but living up to his character of soldier-servant
and escort. By virtue of his late service in the Algerian
army and his rifle, he should have been admirably
adapted to fill that capacity; but less like a soldier,
and more like a whimpering dog, man never looked.
Nor did he look after our things, allowing them to
be badly exposed to the rain, and taking no precautions
for protecting anything. In the face of condemnation
he sulked.</p>

<p>Arrived at Tangier, nearly a week elapsed before a
Hungarian boat put in, by which we could sail for
Mogador. S`lam was of course due daily at the hotel
to report himself and to execute orders. It was on one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
of these occasions, upon the very morning before we
were due to start for Mogador, that he sprung upon
us his intention of going straight back to Tetuan. This
announcement came rather like a bolt from the blue.
We had congratulated ourselves upon taking down into
the interior a more or less tried and faithful knave,
where knaves of such a description were proverbially
scarce; and now our henchman announced that he had
no longer any wish or any intention of accompanying
us to Morocco City.</p>

<p>The reasons or excuses which he gave were: first,
that his wages were insufficient; and, secondly, that
"a courier" had been sent over to him from Tetuan to
tell him that his mother and his wife were quarrelling
to such a degree that Tahara had threatened to go
back to her native Riff country with her brother unless
S`lam returned, and if she took that step it would mean
a divorce.</p>

<p>His wages had been already raised considerably, because
the post he was now to fill had more duties connected
with it: they might have been further increased. The
other excuse may or may not have been true; but as
the two women had never done anything else except
quarrel, the situation was a foregone conclusion. The
old mother may have been trying to poison Tahara again.
But would S`lam trouble to prevent that? Whatever his
motive, it was more than annoying that at the last
moment he should throw us over, leaving no time in
which to look out for a new man, and a reliable man,
without whom, in a country as lawless as Morocco, it
would be a little rash, on the part of two people only,
to travel.</p>

<p>But an unwilling servant is not to be endured. We
gave S`lam his release, stipulating only that he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
return the dollars advanced him for his wife and mother
not many days before.</p>

<p>To this he protested that he had no money, not a
peseta left&mdash;every coin had either been spent at the
feast or had been left at Tetuan.</p>

<p>In this case, the best plan would be, we said, for S`lam
to take with him a letter to the Consul at Tetuan explaining
to him what had happened; then as S`lam earned
money, he might pay it into the Consul's hands for us,
until he had made good the sum advanced him. At
this S`lam looked blank: he said such a letter would
mean <i>prison</i> for him. We stood firm. It was a rude
shock to our faith when his hand found its way into the
leather bag at his side under his jellab, and he pulled
out and threw on the table two-thirds of the money which
had been given him.</p>

<p>It was suggested that he should pay the whole sum.</p>

<p>No! he was penniless.</p>

<p>Then in that case he could sell the new jellab he had
just bought.</p>

<p>He scoffed at the idea.</p>

<p>In reply to our order to come to the hotel the first
thing the following morning and see our baggage safely
on board the steamer, he said that he should leave Tangier
at daybreak, and that it was quite impossible for him
to attend upon us, evidently expecting that his prepaid
wages would be amicably allowed to slide. But not in
the face of this final desertion. We reiterated the former
course&mdash;a letter to the Consul at Tetuan; again he pleaded
abject poverty; but meeting only with inclemency, once
more plunged his hand into his bag, and pulled out
dollars amounting exactly to the sum which he had been
advanced.</p>

<p>So much for his poverty. We were now, he explained,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>
"quits." "All was right between us." He "would not
like to leave us with a trace of ill feeling remaining
between us and himself."</p>

<p>He <i>did</i> leave us, however, with his tail fairly between
his legs, and, if he had been kicked out of the hotel,
could not have gone forth more sadly.</p>

<p>What motive he had for going back to Tetuan, or
what whim seized him in Tangier, remained a mystery.
Impulsive as a child, he had been at first madly keen,
so he said, to go with us to the world's end; then, as
the time approached, in the same ratio his ardour evaporated;
until, finally, he had no more desire left, and on
the march over to Tangier grew more indifferent and
morose at every step. While we were in Tangier he
was like a fish out of water. And yet he had been
once to Fez and to Morocco City: he was a travelled
man. Possibly he had a more remunerative billet in
view, or was homesick, or jealous about Tahara. After
all, whatever the reason, his line of conduct was only
distinctly Moorish, and characteristic of a race in which,
as a whole, no wise man places great reliance. A Moorish
servant will not rob his European master: perquisites are
a <i>sine qua non</i>, of course. Probably his lies are no blacker
than those of European servants; but the Moor, in place
of that quality of faithfulness which can ennoble an English
rascal, has a cold-blooded current in his veins. His
manners may be charming&mdash;he is a plausible devil; but
lean upon him, and he turns out to be as jerry-built as
his own crumbling whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>It is with somewhat of a feeling of banishment into the
unknown, that the passenger by the little coast-steamer
takes his departure from Tangier, and sees first its white
houses and yellow sands, and last of all Spartel lighthouse,
disappear as the boat ploughs southwards. Once upon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
time Gibraltar had constituted in our minds the outposts,
so to speak, of civilization; but since we had spent three
months in such an unexplored spot as the Tetuan vale
and mountains, without society of the conventional type,
or library, or church, or any other adjuncts, Tangier, when
we came back to it, appeared in the light of a Paris. And
now Tangier was again to be left behind; and on one of
the little coasting-steamers, which deliver cargo at ports
on the way, we meant to travel down to Mogador. To
have marched the same distance would have meant perhaps
a month on the road, going by Fez and taking it easily;
therefore we saved much time by taking the steamer.
Though by all report it was not likely to be at all a
comfortable journey, it could only last four days at most;
and few travellers but can stand four days' discomfort.</p>

<p>We did not start without a few warnings and cautions
from various friends, who seemed inclined to think that
we were doing an unprecedented thing in thus setting
off alone into the interior without even a reliable servant,
which since the desertion of S`lam was the case. That
could not be helped. We hoped for the best as regarded
finding men in Mogador.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-35.png"><img src="./images/ill-35_th.png" alt="ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE WAY WE RODE IN MOROCCO." title="ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE WAY WE RODE IN MOROCCO." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Illustrative of the Way We Rode in Morocco.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Nicolson had provided us with letters of
introduction to the British Consul in Mogador, and to a
Moor in Morocco City, where it is unnecessary to say there
are no representatives of the English Government. I had
written to him on the subject of getting up to Glaouia, in the
Atlas Mountains, and had received the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Savory</span>,&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As the Court is away from Morocco City, I hardly
think it would be wise for you to attempt a visit to Glaouia.
Matters are never very <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'staple'">stable</ins> when the seat of Government
is away, and I do not think the Government would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
disposed to give you a permit at present. There would,
however, be no objection whatever to your going to Morocco
City, and I think you will find the journey interesting.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Yours very truly,</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">A. Nicolson</span>."</p>
</div></div>

<p>This letter was a blow. But when we finally reached
Morocco City we found that the thing could be done&mdash;that
we could get up to Glaouia either under the protection
of the English missionaries or with a certain
Jewish trader who lives in Morocco City. The fact of the
matter is, that to travel "officially," as it were, in Morocco
is a fatal mistake. It means a written permission from
the Sultan, an army of followers, a commotion wherever
a halt is made, and a great deal of hospitality. The
Sultan does not encourage Europeans to travel out of the
ordinary line of route, on account of the superstitious and
fanatical spirit of his people, which would be roused to
wrath against him, were he to countenance the invasion
of their sacred land by infidels. Consequently, when he
gives a permit, he writes upon the document to the effect
that the Christian is committed to the care of Kaid
So-and-so, and Kaid So-and-so is to see that no ill happens
to him.</p>

<p>When the Christian traveller arrives at the district
belonging to this kaid, through which he wishes to pass,
he goes to the castle and delivers the permit. The kaid
reads it, and knows what it means: the Sultan only wishes
the Christian to be kept to frequented roads. Therefore
the Christian is offered every hospitality, and the kaid
almost weeps as he explains that it is impossible for the
traveller to proceed&mdash;the tribesmen are dangerous, are in
revolt along the line the Christian wishes to go. The
traveller says he will take his chance. His servants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>
primed by the kaid, refuse to go with him on the score
of the danger. If he manages to get away with one trusty
follower, the kaid sends soldiers after them, fetches them
back to the castle&mdash;to save their lives, he says, and his own
life, which would be forfeited if a hair of their heads was
injured. The Christian, after his rebellious conduct, may
be forced to return discomforted to the coast towns, or
he may be allowed to march on in another direction,
keeping on the beaten track. Thus the Moorish Government
will politely frustrate enterprising spirit on the part
of the infidel. But if the traveller is content with other
than a royal progression through the country, if he will
travel quietly and without ostentation, dressed according
to the habits of the people, and be prepared to "rough it,"
the chances are, that he may get to places which he could
never have reached while impeded by a Government
escort.</p>

<p>But the way above all others to travel in Morocco
is to secure the help of a missionary and to go with
him. Medicine is the golden key which opens every
gate; and a Moor will do anything for a <i>tabiba</i> (doctor),
which is what a missionary practically is to him. The
missionary arrives at a remote village, and the countryside
flocks to him to have its teeth pulled out, its sores
doctored, its fevers cured; and if the tabiba wishes to
go on farther, by whatever path, who shall gainsay him,
while he carries life and health in his hands? He understands
their dialect a little, he dresses as they do, and he
brings no overbearing servants to eat up their substance.
Nor is he a spy, but only some harmless fanatic, some
quaint Nazarene, who thinks to win heaven by thus
walking the earth and doing good.</p>

<p>Thus several missionaries have penetrated to places in
Morocco, from entering which, Europeans are debarred:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>
they have not "advertised" themselves nor written books
upon what they have seen. But the thing has been
done, and not only by men. Women missionaries have
been where no Christian is supposed to be allowed. Indeed,
it should be easier for women, in one way, to travel in
forbidden territory than men, because their sex is not
credited with the sense which could do harm; and the
idea of a woman spying, or thinking to exploit the country,
discover mines, and so on, would be absolutely laughable
to a Moor. Probably women, with a large stock of
medicines and a knowledge of the country dialect, could
travel in the unknown "Beyond" with comparatively little
risk.</p>

<p>There is one other way for the Englishman to see
something of the less-known districts of Morocco, and
that is to travel under the protection of a holy Shar&#299;f.
Shar&#299;fs are, like the Sultan, descendants of Mohammed,
and they possess the holy <i>baraka</i>&mdash;that is, the birthright
of the Shar&#299;fian line. They are little gods, and they
have immunity from the laws of God and man. Their
advice is sought for and followed by the ordinary country
people on every question, and their decision is invariably
accepted as final. There is no such thing as an aristocratic
class or nobility in Morocco; and yet the Shar&#299;fs answer
in a way to the same idea, for they possess a religious
authority which sets them far above their countrymen,
and constitutes them, in a sense, lords over the people.
Besides, they act greatly as mediums between the secular
governors and the tribes, and judge upon various matters.
It is possible for a holy Shar&#299;f to sin, but quite impossible
for him to be punished, the obvious argument being that
"the fire of hell cannot touch a saint in whose veins
runs the blood of the holy Prophet."</p>

<p>The Shar&#299;fian families form an entire class by them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>selves.
They are fed and clothed and housed by a convenient
system of religious taxation, and large presents
are made them, while after death their tombs become
objects of visit to all devout Mohammedans.</p>

<p>A holy Shar&#299;f generally rides a horse, and he dresses
in white, with a blue cloth cloak, or else a white woollen
over-garment. He wears a pair of yellow slippers, or
perhaps riding-boots, called <i>temag</i>, buttoned all up the
back with green silk buttons, and embroidered down the
side with silk and silver thread. A scarlet fez and a
white turban complete him.</p>

<p>Shar&#299;fs never shave under the chin, since the days
when a certain sultan was being shaved thus by a barber
who had it in his mind to cut the royal throat. But a
little boy passing saw the evil design in the barber's
eye. With great presence of mind he rushed into the
shop, crying to the Sultan, "O Most Holy One! the Great
Mosque has fallen down!" Both sultan and barber leapt
up and rushed out: the boy explained matters to the
sultan, and the barber was killed.</p>

<p>But neither Shar&#299;f nor missionary-doctor had we
any hope of meeting at Mogador, able and willing
to travel into the Atlas Mountains with us. We started
with plenty of chances open in front, but with nothing
certain whereon to rely. Telegraph station and all such
vanities were left behind us at Tangier: letters could
not reach us till we ourselves reached Morocco City,
ten or twelve days being the time they would take to
arrive there from Tangier. Our agents&mdash;Cook &amp; Son&mdash;in
the latter place, had instructions to open all wires,
and in an urgent case to forward to us by a <i>rekass</i>
(a runner), who might do the distance in as short a time
as seven or eight days. A wire sent thus, by a rekass,
might cost three or four pounds, according to the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
the man took: the faster he did the journey, the more
he should be paid.</p>

<p>In spite of its hotels Tangier does not possess a single
shop where English newspapers or books can be bought.
Our literature had by this time reached a low ebb; and
on board the Hungarian boat, at a time when one
generally reads omnivorously because there is nothing
else to do, we had but a couple of standard books to
fall back upon&mdash;a history of the country was one, the
other a volume of Lecky. The history was fairly committed
to heart before travelling days were done.</p>

<p>On the whole, when at last we got off in the little
Hungarian steamer, she did not leave much to be desired.
For three days we had hung on at the Continental Hotel,
waiting for the hourly expected arrival of the boat,
beginning almost to despair of her ever coming in.</p>

<p>Finally, patience was rewarded, and one afternoon, with
all our baggage, we went on board. We had everything
wanted for camping out except tents, and these were to
be hired at Mogador. A great wooden kitchen-box held
pots, pans, knives, etc., and a case contained potted
meats, soups, biscuits, and so forth.</p>

<p>R. and myself were the only women on board when
we left Tangier: eight men joined us at dinner that
night, at one long table in the small saloon, and we were
said to fill the boat. She was very small, only eighteen
hundred tons, and there was not much room for walking
about on her; but we never went out of sight of the
coast, and, sitting on a couple of chairs, could see through
the glasses whatever was going on on the beach&mdash;which, I
must add, was little enough, at a time when the smallest
incidents become of importance. The greater part of
the <i>Arpad</i> was given up to cargo. We landed green
tea in quantities at Mazagan, and black-wood, cane-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>seated
chairs for the Jews and Spaniards living there,
as well as bales of goods and casks; but we took
nothing on board, and the <i>Arpad</i> became more and
more like an empty egg-shell, with a decided inclination
to roll, on the swell which invariably sets down that
coast.</p>

<p>The captain, a small dark Hungarian, when we left
Tangier, changed into a thin tweed suit and straw hat:
he did not understand English. There was no stewardess;
but the steward, who did all the waiting at table, spoke
a little German. One of our fellow-passengers was an
Englishman, born in Morocco, without any desire to
leave it&mdash;his horizon Gibraltar: he was Dutch Consul
at Mazagan. Another man was a grain merchant in
Mazagan. All were interesting, and could tell us a great
deal about the country. Certainly the coast-line, as seen
from the deck of the <i>Arpad</i>, was monotonous, desolate,
uninviting to a degree: a long low shore, kh&#257;ki-coloured,
treeless, without sign of life, did not raise in us regrets
that we had come by sea, especially when told that
what we saw, was a fairly correct sample of most of
the country we should have ridden through.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-36.png"><img src="./images/ill-36_th.png" alt="LIGHTERS LOADING." title="LIGHTERS LOADING." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Lighters Loading.</p>

<p>On the entire six hundred miles' length of coast south
of Cape Spartel, and down which we were steaming,
there is not a single lighthouse, bell, beacon, or buoy
to mark a reef or shoal, nor is there any harbour,
and no steamer dares to lie close in-shore off a port
at night. Therefore, as there are several ports at which
cargo has generally to be landed or taken on board,
steamers go on the line of steaming all night, and lying
outside a port in the daytime, while boats carry cargo
between them and the shore. Rabat, Casablanca, Mazagan&mdash;we
stopped at them all, and got accustomed to the
eternal clank of the crane hoisting bales in and out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
the boats; to rolling on to the backs and down into the
troughs of the Atlantic combers.</p>

<p>Finally, we reached Mogador early on the morning
of Good Friday, 1902, and said good-bye to the uneasy
<i>Arpad</i> and its primitive <i>m&eacute;nage</i> without regret: irregular,
white-walled Mogador, set in its rock-locked harbour, lay
in front of us. It was the hot south&mdash;there was no doubt
about that. The Riviera is called "the sunny south,"
and Tangier is warmer than the Riviera; but penetrate
inland into Africa, go down as far as Mogador, and it
is another thing altogether. Here there is no <i>trace</i> of
Europe, but a great sense of being far away in letter
and spirit from England&mdash;farther away than Bombay,
and many another place, which out-distances it in miles
again and again.</p>

<p>We saw Mogador first in a grey light: heavy thunder-clouds
hung above; dim and visionary hills lay behind;
a regiment of camels paraded the wet sands in front,
and lay in the sun underneath the battlemented walls;
black flags floated from the mosque-tops, for it was the
Mussulman Sunday. For the rest Mogador is a city of
sea and sand&mdash;sand, sand, and yet more sand: it takes
two hours' riding to get to anything else except sand.</p>

<p>With the grey waves washing round two sides of it,
and two sides blown and sanded by desert wastes, white-walled
Mogador has a somewhat saddened aspect, as of
lifeless bleached bones, apart from the fact that it is so
far removed from the outer world.</p>

<p>And infinitely remote, it certainly is. A telegram
takes about a fortnight to reach England; so that an
answer by wire to a wire can be expected in about a
month. A letter sent by a special courier to Tangier
takes eight days&mdash;a distance of four hundred miles:
by this means a wire could be sent to England in nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
days. The steamers to Mogador are most irregular,
because, in view of there being no safe anchorage, a
boat will not put in in bad weather. Cargo, passengers,
and mails are often and often enough not landed at
all, and the inhabitants of the city see but the stern of
the vanished steamer with all their letters on board, not
to return perhaps for a week. When the English Consul
married, and his furniture was sent out from England,
the <i>Forward</i> boat, which brought it, came in sight of
Mogador, and, being a rough day, went off to Madeira
and on its round by the Canary Isles, back to London
again, without touching at the sad white city at all. In
this way things are apt to be lost: it has happened
with passengers.</p>

<p>A rowing-boat landed us on green seaweedy rocks,
and we walked up the old shell-encrusted water-stairs,
and under the arch of the Water-port Gate, above which
is carved in Arabic, "The glorious King, my lord
Mohammed, ordered the building of this gate by his
servant Hamed, son of Hammoo, 1184."</p>

<p>Once on a time, Agadir, a city on the coast, much
farther south, was the great port and commercial centre
of Southern Morocco; but it was far removed from the
Sultan's grasp, the tax-gatherer could pursue the even
tenor of his ways without interruption, and the kaid
afford to be dictatorial and troublesome. Then the
heavy hand fell, and the Sultan's armies closed the
seaport, offering its throng of prosperous merchants
the alternative of going to prison or of taking up their
abode in Mogador. This they did, and Mogador arose;
while to work the lighters (the cargo-boats), and to
generally serve the merchants, a company of Berbers
was transported with them from the Sus and Agadir
to the new seaport.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>
Beyond the Water-port Gate we met a line of heavily
laden camels, with a company of athletic Berber drivers
from the Sus, in quaint long tunics of butcher-blue,
and lank black hair: many of the men veiled themselves;
they all looked as wild as hawks, different from
any type hitherto seen.</p>

<p>The familiar Hebrew broker, in dark blue or black
gabardine and greasy skull-cap, was strongly <i>en evidence</i>;
while as to the state of the dogs we met, of them must
the Moorish proverb be written, "If fasting be a title to
Paradise, let the dog walk in first."</p>

<p>Our baggage had all to pass through the Customs
House inside the Water-port Gate; and there we walked,
through great white-walled courtyards, whose vistas, of
arch beyond arch, suggested Temple courts. Donkeys
laden with skins were hurrying across them. Now and
then a train of camels swung along, carrying gum
or wax or argan oil or almonds. In a good almond
year as many as a thousand camels have sometimes
come into Mogador in one day. The Customs House
officer was at breakfast, and we awaited his coming by
our baggage. At last there was a stir among the many
hands who had carried our things up from the boat,
and the most solemn and dignified individual conceivable
slowly sailed upon the scene, way being made for his
flowing robes, which were white as a sheet of best glazed
"cream-laid" before the pen marks it. I handed him
our pass-paper from the Customs House officer at Tangier,
feeling like a humble subject laying a petition before
a monarch: he slowly unfolded it, and more slowly
searched for and produced a pair of spectacles in a
silver case. Lastly, having read the document and reviewed
our pile, he "passed" it with an impressive wave
of his hand. He then took a seat, a Moor minion on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
each side: we filed solemnly past him, shaking him by
the hand. A new-born infant has not such a guileless
face as that bland Arab.</p>

<p>We took up quarters in the Suera Hotel, managed by
a capable Scotchwoman and her husband, who had
once farmed on the veldt. Early next day I rode to
Palm-tree House on a little horse belonging to the
hotel: out by the Beach Gate, we cantered along the
sands close to the sea, crossed the river, left the patron
saint-house of Mogador on our left hand, bore upwards
across the sandy dunes, and struck inland over hard
calcareous rock, where, in the teeth of the wind, the
sand never lies. It was blowing, that day, a hot desert
wind, which in a naturally hot place only makes
one the hotter: with the wind, came a good deal of
fine sand, on a really windy day making riding almost
impossible.</p>

<p>Palm-tree House is a hotel four miles south-east
of Mogador, in the loneliest of situations, with the advantage
of a view and an open, wild country all round:
it has none of the drawbacks of the city; it is breezy,
wild, and bare. Having reached the top of the dunes,
we struck off in more or less of a bee-line for Palm-tree
House, still riding over soft sand, where nothing
but miles upon miles of <i>r`tam</i> (white broom) grew,
lovely when in flower, of which we were destined to
see almost more than enough before we left Southern
Morocco.</p>

<p>The horses ploughed their way through the white track;
two or three butterflies hovered about the r`tam; chameleons
scuttled occasionally over the path; a tortoise
crept along. There were not a few locusts about
either, looking like handsome little dragon-flies on the
wing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>
A last canter along one of the rough rides through
the scrub led us up to the house, planted well on a
rising sand-hill, a view of the sea in front, the hills
behind.</p>

<p>There are no palm-trees, and there is no garden, nor
is there any water, I was told, on the spot; but for all
that, Palm-tree House might have been a satisfactory
lodge wherein to put up. The stunted bush and the
sand fringed the very walls. It had the country to itself,
and there was nothing <i>but</i> itself which could spoil that
country. It was cool and airy and oddly quiet. Inside,
tiles and open patios and big panelled rooms gave all
that could be desired: outside, there was an impression
of simplicity and freedom.</p>

<p>The stables were a great point, and the bobbery
pack, which hunt pig for five months all through
the winter, accounted in one season for something
like nineteen full-grown boar, ten tuskers, and nine
sows.</p>

<p>Palm-tree House belonged for more than twenty years
to a British merchant, who simply provided accommodation
for any sportsman liking to come out and
put up for a week or so outside Mogador: it has still
the air of a shooting-box. The host, in breeches and
gaiters and a great felt wideawake, rode up while we
were there, and offered us every hospitality&mdash;a tall wiry
man, with good hands and seat.</p>

<p>Had time been of no object, we should have moved
on into Palm-tree House. It would be a spot to visit
at any season, for the climate scarcely varies all the
year round: the difference between summer and winter
is not more than five degrees.</p>

<p>Back again in the city and strolling round it that
same afternoon, the conviction was borne in upon us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span>
that of all saddening spots Mogador was possibly the
saddest&mdash;that is, to the traveller, from an outside point
of view: residents may have another tale to tell. But
without vegetation or cultivation within sight, suggestive
of life and change and labour, with the monotonous
roar of the grey breakers beating its seaward walls,
and wastes of blown white sand to landward, Mogador
is the picture of a city which has lost all heart, and
settled down into grim apathy, without a vestige of joy
or activity outside its walls. The overcrowding of the
Jews in the Mellah is a shocking evil, already stamping
the rising generation with disease.</p>

<p>Earlier by three-quarters of an hour than Tetuan at
the same time of year, the city gates at Mogador were
shut at six o'clock, and picnic parties of Moorish or
European traders were hurried back in broad daylight.
We met the basha gravely pacing the sands on a white
mule with scarlet trappings&mdash;of all stout officials, in a
country where it is a sin and a shame on the part of
one in office to be thin, the stoutest. His broad body
overshadowed the big mule, and his two little legs might
have been a pair of ninepins below a vast cask draped
in white.</p>

<p>To the south of Mogador lies first the Sus country
and then Wadnoon, dividing the Morocco which is partly
known to Europeans, from the Sahara, which nobody
knows. The Sus may be said to be practically unknown,
and it is distinctly "forbidden" land, through which only
two or three travellers have ever passed&mdash;Oskar Lenz,
Gatell, Gerhard Rohlfs, and possibly a missionary; but
they were all disguised and went in terror of their
lives; nor have they left satisfactory records of their
experiences.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-37.png"><img src="./images/ill-37_th.png" alt="AFTER RAIN IN MOGADOR." title="AFTER RAIN IN MOGADOR." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">After Rain in Mogador.</p>

<p>And yet the Sus is comparatively close to Mogador,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
with which it trades; mules from the Sus were always
in the Mogador market; camels were coming in every
week with wool, camels' hair, goat-skins, hides, beeswax,
a little gold dust, ostrich feathers, gum-arabic, cattle,
and all the produce of the Sahara; while the Berbers
from the Sus were interesting above any Riffis or tribesmen
with whom we had hitherto met.</p>

<p>Their country is supposed to contain rich mines: it is
said to be fertile and thickly populated; it is not loyal&mdash;on
the contrary, it is ill-affected to its liege lord, the
Sultan; it is fanatical to a degree, and largely swayed
by a form of government best expressed by its title&mdash;Council
of Forty. In return for their own goods the
Berbers from the Sus carry back into their country all
sorts of Manchester goods, powder, tea, sugar, cheap
German cutlery, and the like.</p>

<p>These same Berbers, of unknown origin, were, so the
Kor&#257;n tells us, packed up by King David, in olden
times, in sacks, and carried out of Syria on camels,
since he wished to see them no more. Arrived somewhere
near the Atlas Mountains, their leader called out
in the Berber tongue "Sus!" which means "Let down!"
"Empty out!" So the exiles were turned out of their
sacks, and the country in which they settled is called
Sus to this day.</p>

<p>Wadnoon trades to a great extent with the Soudan,
and Mogador receives an immense amount of its ostrich
feathers: slaves are the most important article of commerce
in Wadnoon, and Morocco is the chief market
for this traffic in humanity, the slaves being brought
chiefly to Morocco City.</p>

<p>But if a fever lays hold of the traveller for penetrating
into the unknown Sus, what must be felt of
the great Sahara, that waveless inland sea of sand, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span>
its eternal stretches of depressionless wastes reaching
on, past horizon after horizon? Perhaps an occasional
oasis, green as young corn; a well; a feathery date-palm;
a melon-patch. But rare are these things, and
for the most part the Sahara is an endless desert which
few Europeans could cross and live. Its ancient lore,
its mystic traditions, give it a fascination all its own.
Imagine the ostrich-hunting on its borders; picture the
natives riding their unequalled breed of horses, the <i>wind-drinkers</i>,
which carry their masters a hundred miles a day,
and which, ridden after the birds up-wind, gradually tire
them down, until they can be knocked on the head with
a bludgeon; the Arabs too, themselves, with the unforgettable
manners possessed by such as Abraham, and
handed down from time immemorial; last of all, Timbuctoo,
the Queen of the Desert, the fabled home of
the voracious cassowary,&mdash;does not the picture imperiously
summon the traveller "over the hills and far
away"? Very far away; for Timbuctoo is twelve
hundred miles from Mogador, and a journey there
would mean at least forty days across the Sahara,
through a country belonging to peoples in no way
friendly towards "infidels," where oases are few and
far between.</p>

<p>Some day we may know the Sahara under other
conditions, for a scheme was started years ago with
the intention of flooding the great desert by means of a
canal from the Atlantic Ocean, which should carry water
on to El Joof, an immense depression well below sea-level
somewhere in the centre. Thus, where all is now
sand, would lie a vast sea: we should "boat" to
Timbuctoo. So far, however, the scheme has begun and
ended in words.</p>

<p>But though the great Sahara is desert pure and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>
simple, it is a mistake to imagine it devoid of life.
Even as there has never yet been found a collection
of aborigines without its totem, neither are there
any extensive parts of the globe where life of some
sort does not exist. The Sahara is little known, chiefly
because the oases in the centre are occupied by intensely
hostile and warlike tribes, whose animosity is
chiefly directed towards the French, whom they hate
with a deadly hatred. But the edges of the great desert
have been visited, and on the northern limits two
animals are found&mdash;the addax antelope, and Loder's
gazelle. The wide-spread hoofs of the addax antelope
enable it to travel over sand at a great pace. It is a
large and ungainly beast with spiral horns. Probably
it follows in the wake of the rains wherever they go;
but what happens to it in the dry season is unknown.
Similarly with Loder's gazelle: though more or less
a desert animal, it is a mystery how it remains alive
through the long rainless months, in places apparently
without water, and on wastes of rolling, wind-drifted
sand.</p>

<p>Of the natural inhabitants of desert country, the Sahara
is by no means devoid: sand-lizards, jumping-mice, sand-grouse,
sand-vipers, desert-larks, and even a family of
snakes belonging to the boas, are to be found. The kh&#257;ki-coloured
sand-grouse are most difficult to see on the yellow
face of the country: the sand-rats and sand-moles all
take on the colour of their surroundings, and thus hide and
protect themselves: one and all exist in some marvellous
manner where it would seem that existence could only
be miraculous. The skink is met with, beloved of the
Romans, who imported desert-skinks into Rome in Pliny's
day, and held them a valuable remedy for consumption,
chopped up into a sort of white wine: the trade was brisk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>
in 1581. To-day the Arabs consider it a remedy, and eat
it as a food. It acts very much in the same way as do
flat-fish in the bottom of the sea, sinking itself under the
sand, allowing the sand to lie over its back and cover it,
like a flounder, only leaving its sharp eyes out of cover,
and sometimes the spines on its back.</p>

<p>For the maintenance of all this animal life, it is quite
possible that rain may occasionally fall even upon desert,
and disappear with lightning-like rapidity; for on the
borders of certain African deserts in the north a phenomenon
very much like the description of the Mosaic manna occurs
when the plains have been wetted with rain. The
surface is seen next morning "covered with little white
globes like tiny puff-balls, the size of a bird-cherry,
or spilled globes of some large grain." It is gathered
and eaten by the Arabs, but, like an unsubstantial
fungus growth, melts or rots in the course of a day
or two.</p>

<p>Enough of the Sahara. Meeting with men in Mogador
who had come straight from the mysterious country, veiled,
untamed, and remotely removed from European touch, our
interest was naturally kindled in that Back of the Beyond.
There is no need for the traveller to penetrate so far as
either the Sahara or the Sus. Long before he reaches
them, and in order to do so, he must cross the Atlas
Mountains by one of the wild passes, and the great chain
of the Atlas is still unsurveyed and practically unknown.
Sir Joseph Hooker and Dr. Ball explored a part of its
valleys many years ago: no one since then has made a
satisfactory attempt to learn details. The chain is supposed
to be about thirteen thousand feet high, and it is about
twenty miles from Morocco City; but the character of
the lawless chiefs and tribesmen who inhabit it, so far
prevents intrusion and exploration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>
In a few days we were to see it&mdash;the mighty, solitary
wall, on which the ancients believed the world to rest,
described by Pliny, rising abruptly out of the plains,
snowclad, one of the world's finest sights: the Atlas had
largely brought us to Southern Morocco.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And all this time you (at home) are drinking champagne (well,
most of it, anyway), and sleeping in soft beds with delicious white
sheets, and smoking Turkish cigarettes, and wearing clean clothes,
with nice stiff collars and shirt-cuffs, and having great warm baths
in marble bath-rooms and sweet-smelling soap . . . and sitting
side by side at table, first a man and then a woman&mdash;the same old
arrangement, I suppose&mdash;knives to the right and forks to the left,
as usual.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hot desert wind in Mogador showed no signs
of changing: there was no enlivening sun, and the
sad white seaport could only charm in a morbid manner:
to be out under the skies, in the open, away from the
city and sealed houses and the <i>eyes</i>, was a thing to be
sought after, and that quickly. Southern Morocco is like
the East in that it is all eyes. The watchful East&mdash;it
may be lazy, but nothing escapes its eyes. They gleam
between the folds of the veil; they look from out of
a smooth face, mild and yet as little to be read as the
deep sea. And who knows what lies at the bottom of
those quiet pools?</p>

<p>There need be no waste of time in Morocco, even as
there is no convention: having decided to start&mdash;<i>start</i>.
The 31st of March saw us away, leaving Mogador with
the intention of marching to <i>Marrakesh</i>, which is the
Moorish name for Morocco City, the southern capital of
the empire. In order to see more of the country we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>
marched by a zigzag route, crossing, but not following,
the beaten track; thus we were once or twice in villages
where European women had not been seen: we met no
one, and we camped in odd, out-of-the way corners, objects
of huge interest to the wandering Arabs with whom we
fell in.</p>

<p>Mr. Maddon, the British Consul at Mogador, to whom
we brought letters of introduction from Sir Arthur Nicolson,
helped us in several ways, and in his turn provided us
with letters to an Arab in Marrakesh. We managed to
buy two mules: one was from the Sus, with a backbone
like a sword-fish and every rib showing, but he was as
hard as nails, and would pace along all day without any
trouble; the other was a lazy beast, fat and older; but
they both of them proved useful animals, answering our
purpose for the time being. We meant to sell, when we
left the country: hiring is expensive work. Of course
it was "just a dear time to buy": it always is. The Jew
broker, through whom we bought the mules from the
Susi to whom they belonged, asked seven pounds ten
for each of them, but came down to six pounds fifteen.
We sold them some weeks later for five guineas each:
hiring would have cost a great deal more. Ordinarily
they are to be bought for five pounds and less in Mogador.
No Susi will trade direct with a European, and every
bargain goes through Israel's hands, which means a big
percentage pocketed by the Jew.</p>

<p>Our hotel-keeper, the Scotch lady, provided us with
reliable servants, one of whom turned out to be invaluable.
Mulai Omar was, as his name indicates, a
saint by heredity. Algeria was his birthplace. He was
twenty-four years old; and having lived in a French
possession, spoke French, not like S`lam, but perfectly.
He was a well-educated little fellow, enterprising, ener<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[<a href="./images/285.png">285</a>]</span>getic;
interpreted Arabic and Shillah for us; acted as cook,
in which capacity he was first-rate; generally organized
the camp; and was our personal servant. Mulai Omar
was quite a man to know, and a friend to trust. He
was unattractive-looking&mdash;small, dark, and dirty; wore a
red fez, a short black monkey-jacket, and immense, full,
white cotton drawers. Sa&iuml;d, our second servant, intended
to look after the mules, was a lazy Arab, who acted
the fine gentleman, and was never without a cigarette
in his mouth. He helped Omar more or less, and was
responsible for much loss of temper on our parts, before
we parted. Another saint by heredity, Mulai Ombach,
looked after our camel, which carried the heavy baggage.
Our fourth and last man, Mohammed, drove a donkey,
nominally for the purpose of carrying provender for the
mules and camel, but which often as not bore either
Mulai Ombach or Mohammed himself. The two principal
servants, Omar and Sa&iuml;d, rode two mules, which carried
light loads as well.</p>

<p>We hired a couple of Moorish men's saddles for our
own use, red-clothed, high-peaked, and well stuffed;
also two big tents&mdash;one for the servants, one for ourselves.
Our commissariat was not hard to manage,
helped out with stores we had brought from Tangier;
for bearing in mind Napoleon's truism that "the army
marches on its stomach," we had laid in an ample
supply.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock saw us finally under way on the
morning of the 31st. We had intended to start at nine;
but any one who has ever travelled and camped out
knows the difficulty of getting away upon that first
morning&mdash;the final wrench between the servants and their
old surroundings, the dozen petty obstacles. In this case
one of the mules hired for baggage turned out to be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
a wretched condition when it came to the hotel, and
another had to be found in its place&mdash;no easy matter.
The camel was started off at half-past ten with our beds,
bedding, cuisine necessaries, part of the tents, and chairs
and table; but, to our disgust, Mulai Ombach, its driver,
stopped short at the bazaar, and there we found them
both when we rode through the city. They were hurried
up, and the whole party seen safely through the city
gates; but once outside, the camel was so slow that we
left them behind, R. and myself jogging ahead with Mulai
Omar and Sa&iuml;d, trusting that the heavy baggage would
catch us up at lunch-time. One more delay&mdash;outside
the Jewish cemetery was standing, waiting for us, the
wife of Sa&iuml;d: many tears were flowing, and sobs to be
heard under the haik. Sa&iuml;d produced some dollars, which
were no doubt intended to last her during her husband's
absence: he then rode on without attempting a farewell,
and we were really off at last.</p>

<p>For the first five miles we hugged the coast in a
northerly direction, keeping close to the sea: the tide
was high; in one place, where we made a short cut,
resulting in rather a nasty bit of riding, we were actually
in the waves, slipping over black rock, with deep pools
on each side. It was a grey day, not hot, and the
hard flat sands, across which we rode for the most part,
were excellent going.</p>

<p>The only wayfarers we met, tramped along behind
camels. Untrustworthy brutes these animals are, especially
the bubbling ones, out of whose way we most cautiously
kept; for though a camel seldom bites, when he does
it is serious. He never forgets an injury. A man in
Mogador ill-treated one badly a few years ago: it went
into the interior for a year, and came back to Mogador,
and met and knew the man at once, taking him by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>
nape of the neck, as is its habit, and tearing the back
of his skull off.</p>

<p>The sandy dunes on our right were covered with
<i>r`tam</i> (white broom), slender, waving, silver-green stems,
in seed just then. Only r`tam could grow in such
poor soil. When we turned inland we found ourselves
amongst dense undergrowth, a small forest, consisting
chiefly of <i>tugga</i> (a sort of juniper), of myrtle, <i>sidra</i>
bushes, and other shrubs, intersected by narrow paths,
along one of which we paced in single file, the limestone
which crops up all over the country making our
pace a slow one. It was the middle of the day when
we found ourselves in the thick of this jungle. Omar
pointed out a little sandy clearing, and in amongst the
bushes, out of earshot of the track, we halted for lunch.
The mules had their packs taken off, and rolled themselves
in the sand. A carpet was spread on a bank; and
there, with the sea still to be seen behind us, the thickets
echoing with familiar blackbirds, and every space glowing
with thyme, iris, lavender, and other flowers, we spent
the first of many lazy hours of the sort. Alas! our
camel was still behind us, and never turned up: that
was a wretched piece of <i>bundobust</i>. But long before we
quitted Morocco we vowed never to have a camel for
baggage again.</p>

<p>Only half-an-hour's halt we allowed ourselves; then
saddled up, and were off again. Still through "jungle,"
and by a sandy path the trail led us, blocked often by
stones and rocks, truly one of those</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>.&emsp;.&emsp;.&emsp;sad highways, left at large</p>
<p>To ruts and stones and lovely Nature's skill,</p>
<p>Who is no pavior.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The flowers became more interesting at every step; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
there was little time to get off and collect specimens,
though the path was so narrow that, riding along, pink
climbing convolvulus and tall lavender could easily be
gathered off the bushes. For any unknown specimen
some one dismounted, and it was stowed away in an
empty tin kettle for safety.</p>

<p>By-and-by we dropped down into a narrow valley,
green and cultivated: a lonely palm-tree or two stuck
up&mdash;the "feather duster struck by lightning" of Mark
Twain. A fine crop of beans was growing on our right,
Indian corn and barley to the left: the land looked full
of heart, rich, and unlike even the Tetuan country. We
came across a man or two working in a dirty white
tunic in the fields, and left behind some wretched huts
down by a spring. About this time we lost Omar's
dog, which was to have been our guard&mdash;a rather lame
lurcher, which thought better of footing it all the way to
Marrakesh.</p>

<p>The country was full of magpies&mdash;not nearly so smart
as our Warwickshire mags, brownish about the tail, and
with less white; yet they could scarcely have been
in bad plumage at that time of year. In a narrow
pathway we stood aside to let a camel pass: since we
had left the coast wayfarers had grown rare for the
most part. The place at which we had halted for lunch
was El Faidar, within sight of one of Morocco's countless
little white saint-houses&mdash;Sidi Bousuktor. Now, after a
long climb over a ridge, we looked down from the top
into a valley&mdash;Ain-el-Hadger; and Omar pointed out in
the distance the spot he suggested we should camp at
for the night. Descending the ridge was the roughest
piece of riding on the road to Marrakesh: the shale gave
way under the mules' feet; great rocks projected on the
track. None of us dismounted, however: Tetuan had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
hardened our hearts and accustomed us to awkward
corners, and the mules were clever. Slowly we slipped
and slid down into the most luxuriant green vale,
set in the scrub-covered hills, carpeted with fields of
young corn, olive-trees, gardens, fruit-trees, and flowers
abundantly.</p>

<p>To the north, upon our left, lay the Iron Mountains,
no very great height, somewhere about two thousand
feet, and famous for iron in the days of the Romans
and Carthaginians, who both probably worked them.
Now they are mined no more, and only known as the
favourite quarters of wild boar, signs of whose existence
we saw for ourselves, in patches of ground rooted and
torn up.</p>

<p>We rode down through these fruitful acres as the sun
was getting low: here and there lay a little white farmer's
house; birds were everywhere&mdash;suddenly we heard a
cuckoo, then a nightingale.</p>

<p>At a place where three little glens met we passed a
tall look-out tower, standing sentry over each one, from
the top of which the Ain-el-Hadger people could easily
see an enemy coming. In England it would have been
a ruin: in Morocco it was in active use,&mdash;it is still "the
Middle Ages" in Morocco.</p>

<p>Leaving a garden on the left, surrounded by a high
tapia wall, we crossed a little streamlet into the brook
which waters the valley, and reached at last a corner
surrounded with grey olives, deep in lush grass, and
overlooked by the inevitable quaint white-domed saint-house
on the top of a rocky hillock. It was an ideal
spot. Omar and Sa&iuml;d laid their two guns under a
tree (they rode with them across their knees, ancient
flint-locks, and carried bullets in bags at their sides,
Omar possessing a French rifle as well); we off-saddled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
unloaded the two men's mules, and unpacked what there
was to unpack, the camel having practically everything.
R. and I strolled about and photographed. A countryman
brought us three fowls and some eggs. The sun
set. Still the wretched camel had not come. Dew fell
heavily, and Omar made a famous fire and supplied us
with hot green tea. At last there were voices; a great
form loomed in the darkness and swung towards us; the
donkey followed. It was not long before the camel
was unloaded, our big tent up, table and chairs and
beds put together, and though dinner was late it was
the more acceptable, The Saint proving a chef. A
pannierful of bread was part of the camel's luggage, and
intended to last us until we got to Marrakesh: vegetables
we had in plenty for the first two or three days.
And Omar worked wonders with the means at his
disposal. Early we turned in: the stars were out; the
frogs croaked in the streamlets. With the tent-flap
tied back, and looking out into the quiet night, we
slept as sound as tramps on the roadside at home.</p>

<p>I woke at 2 a.m. The guard had stopped talking,
and were all asleep and snoring round the tents, except
one old greybeard, who was sitting up by the fire.
Four Ain-el-Hadger men had come to act as guard
for the night, bringing their guns and long knives with
them. It was oddly light&mdash;the "false dawn" of Omar
Khayy&#257;m; but there were no stars.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-39.png"><img src="./images/ill-39_th.png" alt="OUR CAMP AT AIN-EL-HADGER." title="OUR CAMP AT AIN-EL-HADGER." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Our Camp at Ain-el-Hadger.</p>

<p>Such a dawn woke us at five! Every bird for
miles around was singing: blackbirds sounded like England,
wood-pigeons cooed, cuckoos insisted, and among
them all, strange and Indian, a hoopoe called. The
sun climbed up behind the saint-house and solitary
palm; the olives began to cast shadows; the grass
was silver with dew. We breakfasted soon after six,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>
our table out on the green lawn. Such air and scents
of moist earth! It was chilly too. The mules fed
busily in the long wet grass; behind the kitchen-tent
the camel lay, chewing; an old sheikh turned up on
a donkey, and joined the servants at breakfast round
the fire, at one of those meals which were all green
tea and tobacco.</p>

<p>Just as we were starting a party of fifteen sheikhs
and countrymen rode up on their way to a distant
"powder play" at the f&ecirc;te of some saint, two days'
journey off. Passing our camp, they turned into a
little three-cornered field of much poppies and little
corn, and proceeded to bivouac for an hour or two.
Tailing one after another through a gap in the hedge,
on the finest barbs Southern Morocco can produce,
heavy, but handsome in their way (particularly a white
with flowing mane and tail, and two iron-greys), they
pulled up underneath some dense green fig-trees, and
dismounted in the shade, leaving their scarlet cloth
saddles to match the poppies.</p>

<p>There was colour running riot indeed. Several of the
stately figures, all in white, walked up to the saint-house
to pray: one great man waddled down to the stream (to
be great is to be fat, in Morocco), and a few began
to groom their horses. The guns were piled: the sun
glinted on them and on the silver-chased stirrups, and
blazed on the snowy garments, on the poppies, and
the saddles, one of which was blue, another yellow.
We were in the land of Arabs: the Berbers were
left behind at Mogador, and these tall lean horsemen,
burnt coffee-coloured, were all descendants of the sons
of the desert.</p>

<p>By this time the camp was scattered: the camel had
risen from its knees and paced off under its medley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
load some time before, attended by Mulai Ombach,
Mohammed, and the donkey.</p>

<p>The Ain-el-Hadger guard had each received a trifle
for his night's services; Sa&iuml;d had groomed and brought
up our mules; we mounted, and, followed by himself and
Omar, perched on the top of the two packs, their guns
sticking out at one side, rode away. The first few miles
were not marked by anything of particular interest: the
collections of huts and bare walls which sometimes adorned
the hillsides were far away; the curious piles of stones in
the fields, almost like scarecrows, were only landmarks.
But after a time we rode into the country of the argan-tree,
that most interesting and unique specimen, which
flourishes in this corner of Morocco, covering an area
about two hundred miles long and forty wide, and growing
nowhere else in the known world. Southern Morocco
would be lost indeed without argan oil, which is used
for cooking purposes as a substitute for butter, and of
which we had with us a large supply. The oil is extracted
from the fruit of the tree: at the end of March it should
be fit to gather, looking much like a large olive, and
possessed of a green fleshy husk, greedily eaten by
camels, goats, sheep, and oxen. Thus, as well as gathering
the nuts themselves off the ground, the country people
allow their flocks to feed upon the fruit: having driven
them home, the animals chew the cud, disgorging the
argan nuts, which are collected, and eventually cracked
by women and children in order to obtain oil.</p>

<p>The average height of the tree is twenty-five feet, but
its rugged side branches will cover a space of seventy
feet. Gnarled and twisted, the bark is a little like
crocodile-skin, and forms in squares: the trunk has a
way of folding upon itself, too, as it grows&mdash;slowly; for
a large tree may be three hundred years old, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
consequence its wood is immensely hard. The argan
is more or less tropical: though a tree has been known
to live against a south wall in England, it was killed
by the first severe winter.</p>

<p>Among the argans, little oxen were ploughing the
red rich soil of the vale through which we rode; it was
watered by a brook, and real hedges of pomegranate,
out in brilliant flower, divided the fields. In one of
these some Arabs were digging carrots; in another
homely potatoes, the first we had seen, were doing remarkably
well.</p>

<p>By this time the camel and attendants had been overtaken
and left far behind, and since we had passed our
heavy baggage no other forms of life seemed to be
travelling along the same trail as our own: certainly a
countryman joined himself to us, partly to point out
our direction, partly for the sake of company; he held
his stick behind his shoulders and stepped out well, but
not for long. And after he had left we only saw a few
women in the distance. These were often on donkeys,
and some carried water-pots on their heads; but not one
of them was "a beast of burden" in the sense of the
women round Tetuan&mdash;not one crouched under an overpowering
load of faggots or charcoal.</p>

<p>As we jogged on, the great barley-fields, all in ear,
though still green, might have led us to believe we were
in England, except that in the next sheltered spot a
white saint-house would be found, with its dome and
its palm-tree, perhaps a shady olive grove, allowed to
flourish for the sake of the holy place. Yes, it was
Africa.</p>

<p>Farther on, an Arab village lay close to the track, no
windows in its yellowish flat walls, apparently no roofs:
a stoned arched entrance was filled up with thorn-bushes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
and the tops of the walls piled with the same to prevent
outsiders from molesting the inmates. This warlike
tendency was again shown in another watch-tower, built,
like the last, at the conjunction of two valleys.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the bare and uninteresting-looking Iron
Mountains were disappearing from view: another ridge,
which met them at right angles, spotted with argan-trees,
looked in the distance like a tea or coffee plantation
on Eastern hills&mdash;that too faded from sight; and we rode
on&mdash;now through a blaze of flowers, for every hedge
flamed pink and yellow, and even the dry thorns were
blotted with colour&mdash;now past fields of mauve poppies
and scarlet poppies and stretches of stainless blue. A
white saint-house stood out against the colour, its dome
like dazzling chalk, it shadows blue: we looked back
at it from under an argan-tree, in the shade of which
we rested for ten minutes, picking up a few nuts, and
drinking long and deep out of Omar's stone water-jar.</p>

<p>Not far from this spot we came upon <i>Sok-el-Had</i> (the
Sunday Market)&mdash;that is, a place where every Sunday a
country market is held, and to which the whole countryside
flocks to do its marketing. This was Tuesday,
and therefore Sok-el-Had was forlorn and deserted, its
rows of little mud huts and its meat-hangers empty,
not a soul within miles. They are as old as Morocco,
these places known by the name of the week-day on
which the market is held&mdash;places so strangely deserted
upon any other day.</p>

<p>Still we rode on for several hours, past Sheikh Boujiman
Ben Hamed's white house, while the sun blazed on the
bare path, and the argans stood too far apart to cast
consecutive shade. It was with much satisfaction that
we saw our next camping-ground in the distance about
one o'clock: we had started early, and a long lazy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
afternoon was a good prospect. <i>Sok-el-Tleta</i> is named
once more after its market&mdash;Tuesday Market. Even as
Sok-el-Had was forlorn, so Sok-el-Tleta in proportion
teemed with life. Held on the open hillside, upon a
great bare space worn brown by cycles of Tuesday
markets, the prevailing colour brown and white, hundreds
of mules, hundreds of Arabs, the sight was one not to
be forgotten.</p>

<p>We dismounted, and followed Omar into the thick of
the fray, surrounded at once by a staring and interested
crowd. It was an extraordinary scene. Streets were
formed by rows upon rows of little mud cubicles, thatched
over, inside which, on a mud shelf, the vendor sat, with
his goods spread out for sale round him. Slippers were
being mended; blacksmith's work was being done; cottons
and stuffs were selling, sugar, groceries of all sorts, brand-new
slippers and new clothes, vegetables and meat. Meat
was the centre of the whirlpool, and round the carcases
and shapeless joints the largest crowd: it hung on
upright stakes and branches stuck in the ground, and
the effect was that of a nightmare wood, in which the
weird trees were bearing gory and dreadful fruit. It
was all life and stir, that bare hillside; and by half-past
one o'clock the whole thing had melted away, and there
was no sign of a human being moving.</p>

<p>Mulai Omar was well known in Sok-el-Tleta, his wife's
relatives living there: because he was a saint his clothes
and slippers were kissed by every one who met us as
we rode along to our camp beyond the Tuesday Market.
We passed women and children digging for ayerna
root: the corn not being yet ripe, they were short of
food. The root of this weed, though eatable, is most
unwholesome, and unless carefully prepared, people grow
thinner and more yellow upon it daily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>
But all our interest in a few moments was focussed
upon a most imposing ruin, a real Windsor Castle of
a rudimentary type, which commanded a hilltop on a
table-land on the right, great walls rearing themselves
up to the sky, towers defending every corner, a turreted
gate-house the entrance, and the whole loop-holed, grim-looking
enough. Obviously the kaid who built such
a kasbah was a great man: his garden, a beautiful overgrown
wilderness, gone like his castle to rack and ruin,
lay below at Sok-el-Tleta, wisely situated, for vegetation
would have been badly exposed upon the hilltop.</p>

<p>About twenty-seven years ago the kaid who built
the kasbah&mdash;chiefly by forced labour on the part of all
the country people for miles round, though skilled workmen
came from Mogador and were paid&mdash;was attacked
by the Arab tribes from end to end of his province of
Shedma, and after a six-months' siege was forced to fly
to Marrakesh, where he died in prison, the tribesmen
demolishing the castle for hidden treasure, till every
wall had yielded its secret. Probably he oppressed his
province like every other kaid, and was well hated. We
went inside, and it was a foregone conclusion that we
should camp there upon the grass. The governor's own
halls were in a block in the centre, room after room,
most intricate. Our tents were pitched in the vast sunny
courtyard. We wandered about, exploring the odd corners,
all the afternoon: not a vestige of timber or decoration
remained. Handsome little red-brown kestrels with grey
heads hovered over us and sat on the old walls, uttering
their querulous cry: a beautiful blue jay, with cinnamon
back and black-tipped wings and tail, was nesting in
a hole among the bricks, and let us come close to
him. A <i>sib-sib</i> scampered along an old window-ledge,
a little animal like a squirrel, grey with striped back, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
stripes running from head to tail: it ruffled out its tail
at will.</p>

<p>The camel turned up at five, having been nine hours
on the road. Later on a <i>mona</i> (a present) was brought
us, consisting of butter, in a lordly dish set round with
pink roses. So in the deserted walls of the kasbah we
passed the night. Ghosts ought to have haunted those
horrible death-traps, the <i>matamors</i>, of which there are
said to be a hundred. The ground seemed riddled with
these "wells," intended for the storage of grain, but used
by sheikhs and kaids as their private prisons, whence
at their will they draft on luckless captives to the
public gaols: an old enemy is quite harmless in a
matamor, with a square stone over the top, for the rest
of his life.</p>

<p>The wonderful cisterns were another feature of the
kasbah, immense tanks underground, concreted and still
water-tight&mdash;at the end of every dry season cleaned out
and whitewashed, now half full of stinking rain-water
and decay.</p>

<p>We got off at seven the next morning, struck the
main road from Mogador, left it, and found ourselves in
quite an agricultural country, green barley-fields, planted
all over at intervals with figs and pomegranates, even
hedges of a sort. Then again we were in the argan forest&mdash;the
last of it, and the best: beautiful trees, with their
knarled, twisted branches. I thought of yews on the
Surrey hills. Here coarse grass grew between, something
like a park at home: goats clambered up into the forks,
feasting on the green fruit. But all too soon the argans
came to an end, and we saw this phenomenon of Morocco
no more.</p>

<p>Nor was the exchange of the argan forest for the
everlasting <i>r`tam</i> (white broom) and a sun-baked, arid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[<a href="./images/298.png">298</a>]</span>
wilderness, a welcome one. It always meant stones and
sand and a general grilling, the r`tam, as it waved like
pampas-grass to the far horizon. By-and-by palmetto
cropped up, the fan-shaped dwarf palm, which makes
ropes and twine, baskets, mats, dish-covers, leggings, hats,
and girths. Here it grew in the middle of wretched little
attempts at corn-fields&mdash;a drawback to farming, though
from want of water farming might well have been let
alone. Topping a rise, the whole undulating country
was r`tam and palmetto: occasionally a flock of goats
moved on its face, tended by thin mahogany-coloured
Arab boys in dirty woollen tunics.</p>

<p>When a single olive-tree appeared, we hailed its shade
for lunch. The mules, hobbled together, grazed: Omar
and Sa&iuml;d lay at a short distance, drinking green tea
and smoking near the little fire they had lit. Botanical
specimens had to be dried.</p>

<p>That night we camped outside the kasbah belonging
to the most powerful kaid in the whole district: an
immense reddish-yellow pile it was, built of <i>tapia</i>&mdash;that
is, of mud, gravel, and water principally, poured into
bottomless cases on the wall itself, and left to set. The
kasbah had lived through a siege or two, and looked as
if it would "ruin" quickly. From the arched gateway
a crowd of squalid retainers emerged to stare at sun-helmets
and Englishwomen: living like medi&aelig;val times
within the castle's protecting walls, the "feudal system"
practically obtains in Morocco in the present day.</p>

<p>Alas! the governor, Kaid Mohammed, was at Fez: his
<i>khaylifa</i> (lieutenant) received us inside the filthy and
squalid kasbah, seated on a doorstep&mdash;a better-dressed
man than his retainers, curtailed perhaps in intellectual
allowance, who gave us leave to camp outside.</p>

<p>That evening we watched a blindfolded camel turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>
a water-wheel, and some wretched prisoners, with irons
on their feet, who shuffled out of the gate and drew
water. A black slave brought Kaid Mohammed's horses
to water one by one; then made each roll on a sandy
patch of ground, off which he first carefully picked every
stone.</p>

<p>The sun streamed in at our tent door next morning, but
we were at breakfast before it had more than left the
horizon, and soon on our way through a rough country
of scrub and olives&mdash;a capital country for pig (which are
shot in numbers), and practicable for spearing them, one
would think. Jogging along little paths, with a cool
breeze in our faces, which invariably went round with
the sun, we came by-and-by to a valley, green and
wooded with olives, where barley was growing, looking
as if it had been kept under glass, it was such an even
crop, and rooted in the richest soil. Crack&mdash;crack&mdash;ping!
and a stone whistled over our heads: this meant Arab
boys scaring birds with slings, made of dried grass, and
probably after David's pattern.</p>

<p>From out of an Arab village a little black child ran
with a bowl of very sour milk, which, however, Omar
and Sa&iuml;d appreciated: the child wore one filthy whitish
garment and a bead necklace, a little inky-black pigtail
completing it.</p>

<p>This was a day of all days, in that we had our first
view of the Atlas Mountains&mdash;those mountains which we
had come so far to see. There they were, first seen from
a certain ridge, mighty peaks, snow-covered, filling one
with an intense desire to travel into their fastnesses: a
haze, however, hid the greater part of the range.</p>

<p>A countryman joined us for a short distance, to whom
Omar gave a cigarette-paper and a pinch of tobacco.
Again all cultivation was exchanged for uncompromising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[<a href="./images/300.png">300</a>]</span>
plain, stones, stones, and a soil like iron, on which nothing
grew except the thorny zizyphus lotus, with the double
row of thorns, one pointing forward, the other back, out
of which the Soudanese make their zarebas. A colony of
bottle-shaped nests, made of dried grass, in these thorn-bushes,
tempted me to try for some eggs. The attempt
proved what a barrier the thorny lotus can be. I was
extricated with difficulty by means of Omar's gun-barrels
and Sa&iuml;d's hands; but not without one nest and eggs&mdash;they
apparently belonged to a variety of sparrow.</p>

<p>A well with one tree, a spot of shade in the arid plain,
intervened farther on. The mules drank. An Arab
rode up, lean, walnut-coloured; slipped off his high-peaked
red saddle, hobbled his mule, and lay down under the
tree. Hot as it was, we pushed on. This plain is said
to remind travellers of the stony part of the Sahara. In
the air was a scent of burnt grass and flowers&mdash;a <i>honey</i>
smell: every time a breeze came we were duly grateful.
The mules clattered on over the stones until Sidi Moktar
came in sight&mdash;a saint-house of the deepest sanctity, near
which a country market is held one day a week. Up
to this cluster of what Omar dignified by the name of
<i>shops</i> we rode, and, dismounting, stooped our heads,
and took possession of one of the minute mud-booths,
the servants going into another next door. We could
sit upright, though not stand, and there was shade in
the shape of a thatched covering, while after the glare
and flare of the sun outside it was as cool as a cellar.</p>

<p>From one to three we rested there, drank green tea
after lunch, studied maps, took notes. But the sun was
as hot as ever when we took to the open road again,
plain before us, the Atlas dimly to be seen. Some oddly
formed hills, from four to five hundred feet high, flat-topped,
presently appeared: one, from its contour, is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
<i>Hank-el-Jemmel</i> (Camel's Back). We rode past them. A
layer of coarse chalcedony covers the flat summits, which
would offer resistance when, ages ago, the Atlas wall was
scooped into ridge and ravine, and the plain below washed
bare, except for isolated remnants, such as these table-hills.
We picked up fragments of chalcedony and small
blocks of volcanic rock, or basalt.</p>

<p>About five o'clock we reached an Arab <i>douar</i>, or village,
and decided to camp near it for the night. Twenty or
thirty conical huts, made of branches and grass and
anything which keeps out the sun, black camel's hair or
a worn-out garment; the whole surrounded by a great
hedge, or <i>zareba</i>, of the thorny lotus, not growing, but
piled up, one hole left in the fence for exit, and closed
at night by simply piling extra thorns in the space;
a company of howling dogs,&mdash;such is an Arab douar,
and it is probably unequalled for filth, though when the
parasites become too many, even the thick-skinned
Bedouin moves out, and a new douar is put up somewhere
else. There was no choice as regards camping
near such a spot: it may have been unsafe in the open&mdash;at
any rate no servants could ever be induced to sleep
except under the protection of a village or a kasbah.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock. An old sheikh or headman came
out from between the thorn-barrier, welcomed us, and
led the way inside to a perfectly impossible open space,
a dunghill, amongst the huts, where we might camp; it
was overrun with fowls, and covered with filth of every
description. Therefore, though assured that we should
be much safer within the zareba, and deeply against the
wishes of the servants, we insisted upon leading the way
outside, and choosing a spot as far removed from the
fence as possible, though only too near for our own
comfort. As soon as the tents were pitched and the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[<a href="./images/302.png">302</a>]</span>
had set, such a noise of goats (which had just been driven
inside the douar) bleating, and donkeys braying, and
dogs barking, and children crying, arose, as we prayed
it might not be our lot often to hear at the end of a
hard day.</p>

<p>An admiring throng had gathered round us while the
tent was in course of erection, and we were sitting on
the grass. One old woman squatted before us, cross-legged,
not a yard from our feet, and <i>gazed</i>; she wore
nothing but one woollen garment, apparently a square
held together on the shoulders by steel pins: her skinny
arms, legs, and feet were bare, of course. We did not
encourage "the masses," but kept them at arm's-length
with sticks.</p>

<p>That was a noisy night: half the douar was apparently
being entertained in the servants' tent, which for
safety was pitched all too close to our own, and they
talked far on into the small hours in mumbling undertones,
to the sound of which we finally slept, nor waked
till a glorious dawn in a cloudless sky roused us at
five o'clock. The herds were then wending their way
out of the douar, filing across the plain, the mysterious
delicate light of sunrise on the backs of the sheep and
goats. By seven o'clock the sun was too hot to sit in
for choice. We had already breakfasted in the conical
shadow cast by the tent, a group of children watching
every operation, some of them wearing the quaintest
necklaces, of argan nuts strung together, and lumps of
yellow sulphur sewn into perforated squares of leather:
these were eagerly untied and handed over to us for
a <i>bellune</i> (2&frac12;<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p>At eight o'clock we had left the douar behind, and
were heading for Sheshaoua, south of the Camel's Back,
along a trail more stony and desert-like than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[<a href="./images/303.png">303</a>]</span>
before: even the few thorn-bushes did not flourish;
perhaps the white snails, with which they were so thickly
covered that the branches looked all in blossom, did
not agree with them&mdash;snails which are beloved of
partridges. We met no man nor animal, till at last a
<i>rekass</i> passed us, a runner carrying the mail to Mogador,
jogging along the two hundred and seventy miles'
journey, for which he would be paid, there and back
again, thirteen shillings. His stick was tucked under his
clothes, down his back, for the sake of ventilation; his
waistband was tightened; his palm-leaf wallet was on
his back, with letters, possibly some bread, a match or two,
and some hemp, inside. He was a long-limbed fellow,
bronzed and bearded, with the vacant, glassy eyes of a
kif-smoker; for kif kept him going often instead of
food, and helped him to swing along day after day, untiring,
like a camel, sleeping little, praying occasionally
at a saint's tomb, fording the streams, trotting over the
plains, his eyes fixed on the horizon&mdash;"eating the miles,"
as Arabs say. This particular rekass left Marrakesh
on Monday morning at ten, and reached Mogador on
Wednesday afternoon at three, doing his two hundred
and seventy miles in forty-nine hours.</p>

<p>When Sir William Kirby Green died suddenly on an
embassy in Marrakesh, a rekass carried the news to
Mazagan, a hundred and sixty miles, in thirty-two hours;
but the Vice-Consul told me that upon reaching his
office the man fell down&mdash;he could not stand to tell
the news.</p>

<p>We rode on, praying for a breeze which never came:
the sun literally sizzled on the baked desert, the rocks
gave out an oven-like heat, and the rarefied air oscillated
over the wastes. It was too hazy for more than glimpses
of the Atlas and their snows: as far as we could see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[<a href="./images/304.png">304</a>]</span>
stretched only illimitable drab-coloured plain, broken by
the flat-topped hills. At last we stumbled along to the
top of a ridge; and there, strange and delightful sight,
away in the distance lay a green basin, trees, no mirage,
but the valley of Sheshaoua.</p>

<p>Sheshaoua is a district ruled by a powerful governor,
whose great kasbah lies somewhere about the centre,
dominating a large village. The district is watered by
a stream from the Atlas Mountains, which accounts for
its fertility; for, except where irrigation is possible, there
can be no cultivation in this sahara: wide ditches
conduct the stream across the length and breadth of
the province, resulting in a green ribbon upon the face
of the plain, the fields being edged with little hard
mud-banks, keeping the water evenly distributed over
the surface when the crops need flooding.</p>

<p>To have lived upon sun-burn is to appreciate the
colour green: the march lost its monotony and some
of its heat, when green lay in front and came nearer
with every stride. Two hours and a half were short:
the end of that time found us riding between corn-fields,
crossing streamlet after streamlet watering the
vegetation, and at last jogging over real turf, instead
of clattering on stones, which had made talking difficult
for the last day or two; now the path was actually soft
and earthy. A long string of camels kept pace with us
for a time on a parallel trail; then a douar came into
sight, afterwards two saint-houses and a ruined kasbah.
That half of these castles are ruined is not to be wondered
at, considering that they are mud-built, and that tribal
disputes and invasions are interminable. Some of those
same crumbling tapia walls which we passed supported
immense earthen jars, standing out against the sky&mdash;jars
which are stored with corn or butter, and sealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>
up: nine months' old butter has the reputation of an
old wine.</p>

<p>Shady trees, standing for the most part by the stream,
hung over our path, but would have made damp camping-grounds,
and we rode on through a marsh, up one
ridge, down the opposite side, and at last into the
principal village of Sheshaoua, not far from which, on a
hillside to the north-east, lay one of the familiar country
market-places, with its collection of little shelters for the
sellers, its upright branches on which to hang meat&mdash;Thursday's
market this. A ruined, red-walled kasbah
faced it, apparently inhabited by storks alone, busy
building their great rough nests: some were in the village.</p>

<p>Sheshaoua was no douar, but a high-walled collection
of houses, overlooked by the modern kasbah on the
hill. Thither we rode, up the steep slope, to call on
the kaid, Sekassam Belcady, and ask permission to pitch
the tents in one of the gardens which fringed the
stream below. This the khaylifa granted at once (the
kaid himself being at Fez with the Sultan), pressing
on us the alternative of putting up inside the kasbah
itself; but the open air had stronger attractions, and we
wound our way downhill to the stream, on the other
side of which the kaid's own garden lay. There being
no bridge, the stream deep, and the banks steep, the
mules were driven over by themselves, and R. and I
followed one by one on Omar's back&mdash;on and into a
natural garden fit for the gods, one of Nature's own
parterres, and a paradise at that.</p>

<p>On dry ground, underneath orange-trees covered with
blossom, we lunched and lay down: of flowers, except
wild ones, there were none, nor any attempt at cultivation;
the terraces were dense in greenery and shade,
interlaced with branches, intersected by streamlets, per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>fumed
with orange flowers; water murmured; nightingales
answered each other from every corner; wood-pigeons
cooed content; most musical of all, the bulbul's throbbing,
passionate note&mdash;not loud&mdash;was heard for the first time.
Yes; we might have said: "If there is a heaven upon
earth, it is this, it is this, it is this."</p>

<p>The snake creeps into most paradises: suddenly a thunder-storm
invaded ours; heavy rain began even to penetrate
the thick lace of leaves and branches over our heads, and,
walking to the opening at the edge of the wood, it was
clear that heavy storms were working up from the north-east;
nor did the day improve. Having sat through
two downpours, with every sign of more to follow, when
another pressing invitation came from the khaylifa to
spend the night in the kasbah, it seemed foolish to do
other than accept; for bad weather under tents, which
like ours did not claim to be waterproof, has no attractions.
Further, the khaylifa had stated that the guest-house was
new, and had never been occupied.</p>

<p>Thither we hurried through the rain. The inside of
the "castle" was blocked by a collection of filthy-looking
sheds or rooms, which seemed to be full of Arabs and
negroes and women&mdash;wives of the khaylifa&mdash;all of them
squalid and mannerless: the paths between were littered
with refuse. A country kaid, judging from the state
of his kasbah, is possessed of no refinement, and
has less sense of decency and comfort, as European
ideas go, than many members of the labouring class
at home.</p>

<p>The appearance of the guest-house was, however, reassuring:
the long lofty room into which we were shown
had been newly whitewashed, the ceiling painted red and
green; its double doors and two windows opened into a
little courtyard, and rooms beyond housed the servants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
A sheep was being skinned in an adjoining shed: we
were to be feasted.</p>

<p>Meantime, few, if any, of the kaid's retainers could
have abstained from visiting us, to judge by the lev&eacute;e
which we held for more than an hour: perhaps the black
slaves were most interesting, but they were also hardest
to remove, from the scene of such a phenomenon, as two
Englishwomen within their own walls. Probably no such
thing had happened within the memory of man; for
Sheshaoua is off the beaten track to Marrakesh, nor do
travellers as a rule sleep out of their tents.</p>

<p>While we had tea, under a battery of eyes, and further
annoyed by the chatter at the open door and windows,
a <i>mona</i> (a present from the governor) arrived, and was
set down at our feet. It was not the time&mdash;just after
tea&mdash;to eat an immense dish of <i>coos-coosoo</i>, or a steaming
pile of hot mutton and raisins, cooked in oil, which lay
on the round trenchers, when the great beehive-like straw
covers were raised: some of the hot cakes accompanying
them might be managed, but the rest was handed over
to the expectant servants, to whom coos-coosoo is as
roast beef to the British labourer, though less stimulating,
for it only consists of wheat or millet or maize flour,
granulated, steamed, and eaten hot, sometimes crowned
with chicken.</p>

<p>Following hard on the mona came a message from
the khaylifa asking for medicine. Graphically answering
my question as to what was the matter with him, the
messenger stroked his waist: we found a pill, which was
carried off with much gratitude.</p>

<p>A short time elapsed, and then, to our horror, four
slaves arrived, carrying great preparations for tea&mdash;brass
trays, urn, and the whole paraphernalia&mdash;mint and sweetness
filling the room. Again the servants benefited; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
even a third time, after we were actually in bed; for
the door was bombarded, and three women came in, and
laid a great almond pudding, of much delicacy, covered
with stripes of grated cinnamon, at our feet.</p>

<p>That night was the one bad experience of our time
in Morocco. Though the guest-room was new and apparently
clean, some matting had been laid on the floor,
which we had not removed, and with the darkness its
occupants came out in such numbers that, in spite of
"Keating" round the legs of each bed, the long hours were
taken up in warfare, and we never slept. Next day the
room was scoured out, and the lively matting ejected,
while we were strolling round Sheshaoua between heavy
showers of rain, which reduced the clay country to a state
of quagmire. However, Sunday, after a peaceful night
both inside and out of doors, broke fresh and clear: all
the great loose thunder-clouds had packed themselves into
long cloudlets with ruled horizontal bases; and in clear,
rarefied air, standing up almost unearthly in their beauty,
the Atlas range from end to end, was to be seen at last.
Chiselled peak after peak, upon which no traveller has
ever set foot, glistened in the sun, apparently about ten
miles off, in reality more like thirty or forty. It was one
of those mornings which have been thoroughly washed, and
the swirling pea-soup river bore witness to the operation
as surely as the air of purity which the whole country wore.
All was radiant: down below, the orange grove of our
arrival rang with nightingales and bulbuls; there was a
scent of heaven, an undertone of racing waters.</p>

<p class="sc">Ships of the Desert We Pass on the March.</p>

<p>Just as we were packed up to start, the khaylifa sent
and expressed thanks for our medicine, and asked that
as a favour we would see his wives, one of whom was
ill. They were found in mud rooms, dark and dirty,
most uninteresting in themselves. One stout "lady"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[<a href="./images/309.png">309</a>]</span>
had a swelled neck, the other had cataract: both wished
to be prescribed for. I recommended, through Omar,
bathing the swelled neck: it was necessary from a
cleanliness point of view. From the same point of view
I shook hands hurriedly and departed, climbed into the
saddle, and was soon far away from the kasbah at
Sheshaoua.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were once more upon the march; and yet all
links with the kasbah were not broken, for we
had gone but a short way when a servant ran after us,
carrying a familiar dish, known from afar&mdash;a parting
mona. Laid at our feet, we tasted, as courtesy demanded,
a coos-coosoo made of grated almonds, powdered
sugar, and cream&mdash;a sweet which cloys at an early
hour in the day, though to Moorish servants, at any
and every moment of their lives, it is as caviare to
the few. A circle was formed round the dish: in two
minutes, all that was left, was "an aching china blank."</p>

<p>Quantity rather than quality distinguishes Moorish
cookery. The rich man's dishes are more or less like
the poor man's, only that he has six times as many;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[<a href="./images/314.png">314</a>]</span>
indeed, there are said to be dishes of coos-coosoo which
seven men can barely carry. The Sultan's own cuisine
is quite simple, better served, and more of it perhaps, than
his subjects', but otherwise exactly the same.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the mona, our cavalcade started,
and we rode down to the Sheshaoua River, still in heavy
flood, but fordable since the fine night. The waters
roared past between the crumbling banks: we saw in
one place waggon-loads of red soil suddenly subside
with a vast noise into the cataract which had undermined
it. Upon the brink the men stripped themselves;
then, wading into the torrent, hauled across mules,
camel, and donkey one by one: we took our feet out
of the stirrups, and managed to keep dry; the camel
behaved admirably.</p>

<p class="sc">Transporting Our Baggage.</p>

<p>It was an uneventful day, across a bleak and stony
country. Towards evening we passed a ruined kasbah,
rose-red in the sunset. Riding due east, our long sharp
shadows pointed ahead: there was a peace over all
things. The shadowed heights on the right, scooped into
blue gullies and mighty crests, carried a veil of cloud
on their tops: the good little red path we were on,
was without a stone. As the sun dropped we swung
along into a dim grey beyond, to the muffled tramp,
tramp of the mules' hoofs, <i>shuffle-shuffle through the night</i>,
while a cool breeze got up, and a flight of birds high
above us called aloud as they passed over. Ah! but
how good it was!&mdash;no telegrams, no conventionalities, no
possessions worth worry or consideration. Strange, the
influence which such a simple life has upon the mind:
letters, and newspapers, and the topics of the day, and the
world in general, have little interest for the time being, and
get buried in the wastepaper-basket of trivialities, while
the weather, and the state of the track, and little things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[<a href="./images/315.png">315</a>]</span>
in Nature, assume gigantic proportions and fill the
mind.</p>

<p>We camped that night near another red ruined kasbah,
whose long line of crumbling tapia walls against the Atlas
Mountains stretched itself out like a watch-dog beside
the forbidden hills. In the morning Arabs were more
importunate than ever, one woman thrusting her head
between the flaps of the canvas while we were dressing.
A deal, meantime, went on in the kitchen-tent over a
lamb, Omar feeling its neck and tail, and subsequently
buying it for five shillings, after which it was silently
dispatched on the far side, skinned, cut up; and the
donkey bore a pannierful of meat that day.</p>

<p>Our blue jay of the ruined kasbah at Sok-el-Tleta
turned up again on the march, beautiful as ever, and no
less tame; but all the birds shared that distinction, and
were of a confiding nature delightful to see.</p>

<p>Before Frouga, one of our next camping-grounds, was
reached, we passed a kasbah which six years ago was in
the possession of a kaid, who may or may not be still
alive, in prison. His province, at any rate, rose against
him to a man at the late Sultan's death, and wrecked
his castle, the Government disposing of him after he had
escaped to Marrakesh. The orchards of almond-trees,
with thriving beans planted underneath them, and the
fat fields of barley, spoke volumes for the prosperity of
his days. It takes much provocation to induce country
people to rise and rebel against their kaid; for rebellion,
if unsuccessful, brings down such awful vengeance on
the heads of the tribesmen: therefore his hard case was
probably just punishment.</p>

<p>Another river, the Asif-el-Mel, had to be forded on
the same day. It was a bad crossing, we were warned
by one sheikh not to attempt it, and neither of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[<a href="./images/316.png">316</a>]</span>
men knew the ford; but some Arabs turned up, and they
helped to get the mules safely across. R. and I had
each four men with us: we tied our boots, stockings,
camera and glasses round our necks, and rode over,
careful not to look down at the race of the torrent, which
has turned horsemen giddy often enough,&mdash;a raging river
rather more than breast-high is not a thing to be trifled
with. On the banks beyond lay a large and flourishing
village, chiefly remarkable on account of its <i>Mellah</i> (Jews'
Quarter),&mdash;a strange thing to find so far from civilization;
and yet it was not, for the interior of Morocco is full
of wandering Israelites, who, living and dying in remote
Arab and Berber settlements, become naturalized to a
certain extent, yet ever "keep themselves to themselves,"
housed only in their own "quarter," under lock and key
after sundown, and subjected to a few irksome regulations.
Some of them become rich on the profits of the "middle
man," buying skins and produce of all sorts from the
country people, and passing them through to the coast
towns: such men may be worth from &pound;3,000 to &pound;5,000.</p>

<p>It is hard to conceive a race settling from choice amongst
the squalor and filth of the lowest type of Arab, but as
a matter of fact, the Jewish Quarter violated, over and
above all the rest of the village put together, every
tradition of cleanliness. The Berber villages of the north,
dirty enough in all conscience, absolutely shone in comparison
with the Arab douars in the south, or with their
larger settlements, those semi-villages, whose flat-roofed
huts were stacked with earthen or basket-work jars.
These bottle-shaped jars, full of what Mohammed calls
"the liquor of the bee," cream-cheese, barley, etc., were
plastered with mud, and waterproof: when they occurred
in twos and threes on every roof, the effect was striking.</p>

<p>It would have been a monotonous ride to Frouga except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[<a href="./images/317.png">317</a>]</span>
for the Atlas Mountains on our right, which we had been
steadily nearing for days: now comparatively close, their
gleaming snow-peaks were never without interest, and
Omar told tales of travellers' experiences up in one or
two of the passes. The principal roads across the chain
to Taroudant, Ras-el-Ouad, and the Sus, pass through
Frouga, and make it an important place. It possesses
an <i>inzella</i>, or sort of fond&acirc;k, where men and transport
are safe for the night under the protection of the kaid
of the district.</p>

<p>We pitched our tents among little fields of beans
and barley, planted with olive-trees, close to a mosque,
and awoke when <i>es-sbar</i> (sunrise) was called in sonorous
tones from the top of the dome: a cuckoo answered
the mueddzin, and a pair of little doves began to coo
persistently.</p>

<p>The gardens of Frouga are celebrated&mdash;full of vines
planted like hop-gardens, of prickly pear, figs, pears,
apricots, and corn, in between the fruit-trees. And yet
the owners are not rich: the governors of the district
see to that; for supposing a man becomes richer than
the governor, X., he goes to the Government and says, "If
you make me governor instead of X., I will bring you
more money than he does, and here is a present at
the same time." The Government accepts the bribe, and
gives the man a letter stating that he is made governor
instead of X. The man collects his friends and ousts
X., perhaps imprisoning him for life. A governor, therefore,
never allows a man under him to possess capital.
He may be rich in cattle and gardens, but he will have
to pay the governor out of his profits from thirty to
ninety shillings at stated times all the year round, and
never have any "spare cash." If he refuses to pay, he
is turned out of his own home and acres, which fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[<a href="./images/318.png">318</a>]</span>
into the governor's hands. Naturally he prefers to cling
to his gardens.</p>

<p>Beyond Frouga lay some of the most fertile land in
Morocco. We passed wonderful crops of barley and wheat,
which in an average year, for every bushel sown, yield
forty bushels. Moors say that corn in Morocco is known to
yield, not forty, but a hundred-fold. In England fifteen-fold
is considered an average crop. Morocco grows two
crops each year: there is a spring harvest and an autumn
harvest. It would seem, therefore, that if agriculture were
encouraged, and light railways laid down to the coast,
money would pour into the country&mdash;especially supposing
that, instead of wheat, such a crop as linseed was grown.
Russian and American competition would probably
diminish the profits to be made out of wheat, but a soil
and a climate like Morocco might grow anything and
everything. At present fraud and dishonesty seem the soul
of trade: the Jew brokers cheat the Moors; the Moors
sand their sheep's wool to make it heavy, mix paraffin
candles with their beeswax, put all manner of things into
oil, and so on. But a single example shows the spirit
of the country. A friend of ours found his horses becoming
poor, yet he saw their corn taken out to them
every evening: he examined it; it was quite good. After
a time it occurred to him to look inside the horses'
mouths, and he found the gums cut and lacerated in
order to prevent their eating their barley, which, after
it had lain a certain time on the ground untouched,
was confiscated by the servants.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-43.png"><img src="./images/ill-43_th.png" alt="MARRAKESH." title="MARRAKESH." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">Marrakesh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, each day as we marched on, brought us
nearer to our bourn, and at last we found ourselves on
a wide flat plain, unbroken, except by the trail which
we followed, consisting of six or eight narrow paths,
winding on side by side like railway rails&mdash;a splendid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[<a href="./images/319.png">319</a>]</span>
"high road" for Morocco. Truly it is a spare-room
country. The snaking track might take up acres and
acres of rich land. What matter! There is room.</p>

<p>It was still very hot: smoked spectacles kept off a
certain amount of glare, and I wore two hats, a straw
on top of a felt, having neglected to bring a solar topi;
but even so the sun was unnecessarily generous, glowing
on the splendid polish which some of the Arabs carried
on their sepia-coloured skulls, and making it impossible
to follow the crested larks, singing their heads off, up
in the brilliant sky.</p>

<p>At last we felt a breeze, topped a low rise: an old
greybeard all in white jogged up towards us on a
donkey, a man running behind; a village lay below; but
our eyes only went to one spot in the wide blue plain,
which was spread out like a praying-carpet before us.
That spot lay twenty-five miles off&mdash;a single tower, the
Kutobea in Morocco City.</p>

<p>"Marrakesh!" cried Omar and Sa&iuml;d simultaneously.</p>

<p>We rode on, across dry plain, over old river-beds,
through patches of olive-trees, pink oleander, and castor-oil
plant; leaving Arab douars behind; meeting with
white cow-birds which recalled Tetuan; passing men
with merchandise on camels and donkeys, strings of
country people, and wanderers of all sorts; stopping
to rest near wells where swallows were building in the
brickwork and donkeys stood asleep in the shade; watching
Arabs beating out corn with sticks, men ploughing,
until we were once more amongst "greenery" and in
a fertile stretch of country. Surely there was a river
near. We passed fine crops of maize; onions were doing
famously; fields of bearded wheat rustled in a life-giving
breeze. And then the Wad-el-Nyfs, the largest river
we had to cross, came into sight. Sa&iuml;d at the outset<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[<a href="./images/320.png">320</a>]</span>
precipitated himself into a great hole, and was well ducked:
eventually we all landed safely on the other side, though
the start was far from reassuring, some Arabs on the
bank telling us it was "not good" to cross, and wading
down into the torrent, for us to see that the water took
them up to their necks almost at once, sweeping them
down-stream. Before we rode into the water every
man divested himself of each particle of clothing which
he wore; and R. got across with two dark-skinned individuals
clinging on to her legs, one on each side of
the mule, a third hanging on to its bridle, and a fourth
at its tail; while I followed also with four attendants.
Not long ago, a party of missionaries was fording one
of these very rivers, and neglected to have men at the
mules' heads, one of which stumbled and threw its rider
into the rapid stream: she was drowned. It was not
deep at the time, or more precaution would have been
taken: on the other hand, the stream is always like a
mill-race, an accident can happen in a moment, and
therefore a rule should be made, and never under any
circumstances broken, to the effect that every rider have
a man at the mule's head, and more than one, according
to the state of the river.</p>

<p>We had a long hot ride to Tamsloect: the breeze,
which was westerly, was useless to us; the track led over
stony yellow hills; now and again we caught glimpses
of the Kutobea standing up very far away; and all the
time the great snow-fields, on the vast mountains, close
upon our right, looked tantalizingly near and cold. Occasionally
we watered the mules at a stream: tortoises were
swimming about in one of these. But on the whole it
was a singularly uneventful and a very sultry ride, until
at last long lines of red mud walls, many gardens, three
mosque towers, and some tall, dark, green cypress-trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[<a href="./images/321.png">321</a>]</span>
proclaimed Tamsloect&mdash;an important village, possessing
a Friday market, an unequalled view of the Atlas, and
a saint, Mulai Abdullah Ben Hassi.</p>

<p>An Arab, Hadj Cadour, is one of the great men in
Tamsloect; and to him, having an introduction, we went.
The best hours spent in Morocco were those lived with
certain of the Moors themselves, sharing for a short
time their simple and yet fantastic life, learning something
of their innate courtesy and generous hospitality.
Hadj Cadour was a host of the old aristocratic school.
He was out at his garden-house when we reached the
village, entertaining friends at a tea party; and upon our
message reaching him, he sent back a man on a white
horse to point out another of his gardens close at hand,
where he suggested that the tents should be pitched,
while R. and I rode out and joined his tea party.</p>

<p>Leaving Omar to superintend the camp, we started off
after the rider on the white horse: he led the way through
the village, finally into a labyrinth of gardens, where we
brushed through bearded wheat such as I have never
seen before nor since, which luxuriated with olives, fruit-trees
of all sorts, and pale pink monthly roses. Presently
in the midst of the semi-wilderness a little white house
intervened, half buried in trees, and close to it, in the
shade, under an olive, was gathered Hadj Cadour's tea
party, six or eight dignified Arabs, in those perfectly
washed and blanched garments which so fit their solemn,
dignified manners, their sad and intellectual type of
faces: not that Moors are necessarily either of the two
last; but they look it&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>A great tea-kettle, as usual, loomed in the background;
carpets and thick red Morocco leather cushions made
seats for the members of the charmed circle: we reclined
there with the rest, talking, as far as a few Arabic words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[<a href="./images/322.png">322</a>]</span>
would carry us, of our starting-point, our destination, the
road, the rivers, the weather, Hadj Cadour helping us
out, one and all interested and anxious to be understood
and to understand. Our host dispensed <i>sherrub de minat</i>,
the wine of the country, made from grapes; the little
dome-shaped pewter teapot was there, with its fond
associations of Morocco, together with the copper tray
and circle of diminutive painted glasses; a gorgeous indolent
sun poured down beyond the patch of shade; the
hum and hover of insects vibrated in the air; and presently
musicians were summoned&mdash;girls wearing pale green jellabs
and silver ornaments, with yellow handkerchiefs twisted
round their heads, men in bright colours. Sitting down
between us, each was given a glass of sherrub de minat,
and by-and-by they began to play. Weird and wild
music it was, that of the <i>tareegea</i>, the <i>gimbi</i>, and the
<i>tahr</i>, quaint native instruments of the roughest construction,
and yet, as music, possessing fascination not
a little.</p>

<p>The long kif-pipes were lighted, green tea and wine
were sipped, the white figures stretched themselves on the
cushions, and a great and dreamy content came over the
faces under the white turbans. There was nowhere a
trace of boredom such as mars so many European entertainments&mdash;rather
the thing was loved for itself, and every
man felt it and entered into its spirit. Now and then
the musicians broke into a strange song, and the guests
beat their hands and murmured in chorus; then again
they would seem half intoxicated, in a harmless fashion,
with kif and wine and music, and would appear to be
absent in a world of their own. The music had a lilt
in it, and often a suggestion of something half tamed,
desperate, swung along with the cadences; and thin
wreaths of smoke from the long pipes blew up through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[<a href="./images/323.png">323</a>]</span>
the olive branches, and an Arabic sentence dropped now
and again on the ear: the hot, slow, sleepy afternoon
waned. . . .</p>

<p>Poetry bulks so largely in the Arabic nature. Emotional
and yet simple, that nature is, to a certain extent, appealed
to by the refined. The sordid and vulgar have no
attractions for it. There is no language more poetical
than the Arabic language, where "snow" is called "hair
of the mountain" and "rainbow" is "bride of the rain."
"Red mullet" is "the sultan of fishes": "maiden-hair
fern" is translated by "little cane of the well." Ordinary
Arabic words show an extraordinary gift of description:
the word for "secretly" means literally "under the
matting," and "never" is expressed thus, "when the
charcoal takes root and the salt buds."</p>

<p>Uncontrolled ascendency of imagination marks the Arab,
and endows his nature with a fascination all its own:
an outdoor life is his heritage, and the things of Nature
are a part of himself. "Spring" he calls "grass";
"summer" is "gleaning"; "autumn" is "fruit"; "winter"
is "rainy."</p>

<p>If only he could keep pure his race, Morocco had never
stood among the nations where she stands now. The
steady infusion of African blood is becoming her ruin: the
sensual negro type, spreading rapidly, is eating its way
into the heart of the people. When it is remembered
that thousands upon thousands of slaves are imported into
Morocco from the interior of Africa every year, that they
become eventually "free," their children inheriting equal
rights with other children, it is no longer a matter of
wonder that the Moorish race shows signs of deterioration,
that its people are effete. It is after meeting with men
such as Hadj Cadour and many others, who hark back
to the old type of chief and horseman and the desert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[<a href="./images/324.png">324</a>]</span>
life, touched with the old vein of poetry and chivalry,
that one regrets the things which are. But we had
spent an afternoon which was one worth recollecting;
and when we had parted from that little circle under
the shady olive, and were jogging back to our tents, it
was to remember that there are still good things in
Morocco.</p>

<p>The tents we found ready for us in a delightful spot
enclosed by a wall: a tank lay in the centre of the garden,
around it a few paths, and a great deal of mint. But a
terrible ordeal awaited us&mdash;green tea and a great spread,
provided by the brother of Hadj Cadour, who had also
arranged carpets as seats around the tank. Again next
morning, just after we had finished breakfast, this hospitable
individual sent into our tent two steaming hot
chickens fried brown in argan oil, with half a dozen
round cakes of fine <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'floor'">flour</ins>; and when, immediately afterwards,
we rode to his house to say farewell and tender
our thanks, he proffered green tea once more.</p>

<p>Heavy drops of rain awoke us in the middle of the
night; but just as an ominous patter was coming through
the old canvas and sounding on the bed-clothes, the
shower stopped. Again later it came on, with thunder.
Omar changed the smart clothes which he had put on
in view of a triumphal entry into Marrakesh; we packed
and got off as quickly as we could, expecting more rain;
many good-byes were said; Hadj Cadour sent a servant
with us to the gates; and we rode out of Tamsloect.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-44.png"><img src="./images/ill-44_th.png" alt="THE OPEN GATE." title="THE OPEN GATE." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">The Open Gate.</p>

<p>Outside, towards the east, its gardens were numerous:
great black poplars and palms grew freely. For an hour
we rode alongside a district which belonged entirely to
Mulai el Hadj, the great man of Tamsloect, and a holy
Shar&#299;f to boot. This man is rich, and because he is a
holy Shar&#299;f he can never be dispossessed of his wealth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[<a href="./images/325.png">325</a>]</span>
His white house and cypress-trees stand out prominently
in the village we had just left; throughout his gardens
he has built a succession of water-towers, which irrigate
his land; he is British-protected, and as important a
man in the south as the French-protected Wazeer of
Wazan is in the north.</p>

<p>All this time we were riding steadily towards Marrakesh,
interest increasing with every step as we neared
the city, to visit which we had left Mogador about ten
days before.</p>

<p>That last day's march was not an interesting one:
the great Atlas, upon which we had now turned our
backs, were no longer to be seen, on account of clouds
which the last night's storm had brought upon them;
the plain over which we rode possessed a deadly monotony,
for we were not entering Marrakesh upon its best side,
where gardens upon gardens of palm-trees stretch beyond
the city gates for miles and miles, but our road from
Tamsloect was prosaic and dull. Certainly we crossed
some of the wonderful underground canals, which carry
water five and ten miles, from springs in the country,
into the city&mdash;about whose origin nothing whatever is
known, tradition remaining silent as to any builder. These
great works are merely water-ways tunnelled through the
solid earth, not at any great distance from the surface:
along their courses the streams are conducted for great
distances. There are openings at intervals which ventilate
the tunnels: these are kept clean and easily examined
by means of the same. The whole arrangement is very
rough, very primitive, but perfectly answers the purpose
for which it was made.</p>

<p>The crops which we left behind us at every mile
looked well, and it was to be hoped would soon make
good the failure of the preceding crop: that failure had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[<a href="./images/326.png">326</a>]</span>
accounted for the skinny children and lean women whom
we had met, and was the reason of the country people's
continuous digging for ayerna root, and washing the
same by the roadside and in so many villages.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Marrakesh and its adobe walls, of a sad
yellow-pink tone, grew nearer and nearer, till at last the
long line of crumbling tapia was but a short distance
off, and the B&aacute;b-el-Roub, a massive gateway, plainly
to be seen. Just outside the walls, Mr. Miller, one of
the missionaries, met us: he had one piece of news, which
carried with it regret wherever it was heard across the
length and breadth of the British Empire&mdash;the death of
Cecil Rhodes. Under the B&aacute;b-el-Roub we rode into the
city of crumbling walls and silent sandy roadways: somewhat
of a deserted city, the great southern capital appeared
to be at first; but then we were nowhere near its heart,
and the half of it is gardens and quiet houses, while a
small part only, is wholly full of vitality: the whole is
crumbling to pieces, and strange of all strangest cities
ever seen.</p>

<p>We rode straight to Kaid Maclean's house, lent us by
Lady Maclean&mdash;the best house in Morocco City, over-looking
one of the many market-places, and that open
space in which story-tellers and snake-charmers, surrounded
by a dense circle of admirers, cater to an attentive throng.
The house was empty, and we "camped" in several
of the rooms, lunching in a long gallery which looked
straight out on to the Atlas Mountains: the mules went
into a capacious stable; the servants made themselves
comfortable in the kitchens. It is hard to find house-room
in Marrakesh: of course a hotel is unheard of,
nor is camping-ground to be met with easily. There
are no foreign consuls in this far-off city, and no English
element beyond the two or three missionaries who live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[<a href="./images/327.png">327</a>]</span>
there. Travellers have generally to depend upon the
loan of some house for the time being, from a holy Shar&#299;f
or Moor of some standing; but the house may be anywhere,
and comfortable or otherwise. Since the Sultan
was at Fez, his army and his commander-in-chief, Kaid
Maclean, were at Fez too: hence the reason of the
Macleans' house standing empty, within which we were
so fortunate as to find ourselves.</p>

<p>Marrakesh cannot be described: it must be seen.
It is more suggestive, more intangible, more elusive&mdash;that
is to say, its Eastern medley of a population is so,
and its crumbling tapia-walled houses are so&mdash;than any
other Moorish city. More ghosts should stalk the half-deserted
yellow roadways of Marrakesh, more mysteries
be shrouded within the windowless walls, than a man
of Western civilization could conceive.</p>

<p>It is a vast city&mdash;other writers have chronicled the
number of square miles which it accounts for&mdash;and yet,
in spite of its size, the sum-total of souls it contains
is not overwhelming. There are gardens everywhere,
stretch after stretch of palm-trees, acre after acre of fruit-trees,
and wedged among them all, lie the flat roofs,
swarm the endless throng which spells humanity; and
the oddest, most varied humanity&mdash;Arabs and negroes,
men from the Sus, from the Sahara, from Draa, Berber
hillmen, tribesmen from the Atlas, a tumultuous multitude,
a hive of bees of whom no census has ever been
made. We were among them all, the first time we rode
through the city. No one walks in Marrakesh: as a
matter of fact I did later on, often enough, sometimes
alone, getting somewhat jostled in the narrow ways&mdash;beyond
that in no way inconvenienced. But every one
who can, is on a mule or a long-tailed countrybred,
pushing along at a foot's pace, crying out now and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[<a href="./images/328.png">328</a>]</span>
then, and avoiding this pair of black toes, that coffee-coloured
bare heel.</p>

<p>Beyond the wall, covered with nails, whereon heads
are fastened after rebellions have been quenched and
the time of punishment and warning has come, we rode
into the land of little shops. Here, in another instance,
Marrakesh is unique: the narrow streets were in great
part entirely roofed in overhead either by vines or by
bamboos; the brilliant sunlight streamed through the
spaces between the vines and canes, and chequered the
seething white throng which eternally passed underneath
it. From an open street we plunged into the cool shade
of one of these arcades. And how it moved! Nothing
ever stood still in the Marrakesh soks. Life "travels"
for ever and for ever there. Between the shops, themselves
teeming with bustle and incident, moved up
and down, the throng of white, draped, dignified figures,
calling, heaving, struggling, jostling sometimes, chattering
always, blotched with shifting yellow sunlight and
black shadow cast by the lattice roof overhead. It
was a transformation scene; it was a weird dream&mdash;weird
to the point of seeming unreal, unlike men and
the haunts of men, though all the time rampant with
<i>humans</i>.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-45.png"><img src="./images/ill-45_th.png" alt="THE KUTOBEA, MARRAKESH." title="THE KUTOBEA, MARRAKESH." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">The Kutobea, Marrakesh.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><i>Photo by A. Cavilla, Tangier.</i></p>

<p>When the Sultan went to Fez, a party of soldiers
and goldsmiths and craftsmen of all sorts went with
him from the city of Marrakesh, in number over forty
thousand souls. But the exodus made no appreciable
difference in the soks. Not only the numbers, but the
types of the stream of faces between which we rode
were all striking, and each one so far removed from
anything at all European. Humanity can indeed be
separated from humanity by gulfs impassable, or gulfs
which may alone be bridged over by a violation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[<a href="./images/329.png">329</a>]</span>
nature, on the part of the man upon the east bank or
upon the west bank.</p>

<p>The palm-trees wave above Marrakesh, turtle-backed
mosques and tall towers rise among the gardens and gleam
in the sun, but above and beyond every other feature of
the far-away fantastic southern capital one watch-tower
rises over everything and rears itself into the sky&mdash;the
Kutobea, built, according to tradition, by Fabir for the
Sultan El Mansur. It stands in a vast empty space close
to the Great Mosque: few people pass that way&mdash;their footfalls
are almost unheard in the soft sand; and the lonely
tower cuts the clear quiet sky. The Kutobea is built
of dark red stone. There is a pattern, alternately raised
and sunk, on the faces of the minaret, the sunk part
cut deep, the raised part carved and standing out. A
broad band of wonderful black and green iridescent
tiles, snakes round the top like some opulent spotted
serpent. Part of it has dropped away: the gilded brass
balls, the cupola, are here and there tarnished; but
the sun sets, and his indulgent rays swamp every defect,
burnish and polish and gild corner-stone and fretted
marble and emerald-green tile alike, until the "to-day"
of the Kutobea is as triumphant as its "yesterday" of
many hundred years. The design of the tower itself&mdash;the
minaret&mdash;is said to have come from Constantinople,
as did the Giralda at Seville, which it so resembles.</p>

<p>Of the mosque, beside the Kutobea, nothing was to
be seen except its walls, and through an open door
avenues of pillars. The huge building has an Arabic
name meaning "The Mosque of the Books"; for what
reason&mdash;who can tell?&mdash;tradition is silent.</p>

<p>Marrakesh itself is supposed to have been built
upon the site of an immensely old structure, the
ancient Martok. As it is now, Yusuf-ibn-Tachfin founded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[<a href="./images/330.png">330</a>]</span>
it in 1072, a city which covers almost as much ground
as Paris&mdash;a purely African city. Fez, Tetuan, Tangier,
have Spanish blood in them: Marrakesh is African to
the core. Arabs here are in a minority: the spare
Saharowi type, the shaved lip and cheeks and pointed
chin-tuft of the Berber race, men from the mysterious
sandy steppes below Cape Bojador, Soudanese blacks,
men from Wadnoon&mdash;one and all congregate in this
city. Even the music and songs are, naturally enough,
all African, with the strange interval, the rhythm which
halts and races where no European music ever halted
or raced; and the tom-tom, the gimbri, the ear-piercing
Moorish flute, all fall upon the English ear as things
intensely strange and strongly fascinating.</p>

<p>Marrakesh boasts no aristocracy: it is a city of the
people. It has few Shar&#299;fs: it is a land of "traders,"
speculating, toiling, intriguing; between its yellow adobe
walls, and its whitewashed dazzling walls, amidst its dense
metallic semi-tropical vegetation, up and down its sandy
silent ways, they live and die. Its fountains are beautiful:
<i>Shrab-u-Schuf</i> (Drink and admire) is inscribed on
one of them. But it is not by its architecture that
Marrakesh stands and falls; rather by a personality all
its own&mdash;by its many ruined walls, by its deserted streets,
by the hot pulse of life throbbing imperiously through
its arteries crowded to suffocation with humanity, by its
flaring African sunlight, by the figures which can never
be other than picturesque, by a thousand impressions
which can never die. And by reason of all this
Marrakesh is great.</p>

<p>Once upon a time it was impossible for an Englishman
to see the Slave Market. Owing partly to the
radical hatred of Europeans, partly to the suspicious and
seclusive nature of the Moor, the presence of foreigners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[<a href="./images/331.png">331</a>]</span>
in the sacred Slave Market was tabooed. Not that the
Nazarene was "taken up" or turned back if he showed
his face inside the courtyard: on the contrary, he was
allowed to walk in, and apparently no eye was aware
of his presence. And yet in a few moments he would
find himself alone. The Slave Market had vanished, had
melted away: a line of disappearing backs was all
which was to be seen. Supposing a Moor had connived
at this attempt on the part of a Nazarene to see slaves
being sold, that Moor disappeared, by order of the
Sultan, and there was a funeral later on in the day.</p>

<p>However, while we were in Marrakesh, less rigorous
orders were in vogue. Having come prepared to see
the market disguised in native dress if necessary, we
found that we were able to go there without much
difficulty, and only escorted by one of the missionaries
and a servant. Though slaves are bought and sold
through the length and breadth of Morocco, it is not
possible in any other city than Marrakesh for the
European to see or know much about it. In the coast
towns the sales are conducted privately. In Fez it is
probable that they might be attended by others than
Moors; but at the time of writing I take it that no wise
European, if such should be there at all in these unquiet
times, would venture to put himself into a position
likely to attract all the bullets and knives in Fez in
his direction.</p>

<p>Just at sunset&mdash;6.30, I think&mdash;the Slave Market in
Marrakesh opens, and we went in. To some ears it
would no doubt have sounded the strangest anomaly,
that prayer to the Most High God, with which the
sale was prefaced; but a Mussulman hallows every
action, right or wrong, with a petition; besides which
slavery is lawful and good in his eyes, is approved of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>[<a href="./images/332.png">332</a>]</span>
and permitted by Mohammed in the written book of
the Kor&#257;n; is, in short, a part of the scheme of Nature
which it were a serious mistake not to use and enjoy.
So the line of auctioneers formed up, held out their hands,
prayed, invoked a blessing over the proceedings, mumbling
in sonorous tones for a few moments. Then silence.
It was over: the sale began. There is nothing more
easy than to be theatrical and emotional in describing
scenes of this sort&mdash;one has read of them scores of times:
words such as "degrading" and "harrowing" rise up
in the mind's eye, coupled with violent epithets and
stinging clauses. And yet, finding oneself in the centre
of another just such a scene, one realized how impossible
the thing was, to understand, or to feel, beforehand, and
how curiously it played upon the emotions. Walking
into the market with a sobriety, with a cold, critical
interest such as a Nero may have felt towards his victims,
one divined early in the proceedings that the scene tended
unduly to intensify emotion. Truly no men think alike:
a vast chasm yawns between the natures of the slave-trader
and the European: that chasm is a universal
education. To realize all which separates a native of
Africa from a Frenchman or an Englishman, and the
difficulties which lie in the way of promoting an understanding
between the two, visit such a place as the
Slave Market in Marrakesh.</p>

<p>Groups of slaves, more or less gorgeously dressed,
some in rags where nothing better could be afforded,
were sitting far back in little covered-in recesses which
lined the square. All round the square stood, or sat
upon their heels, intending purchasers, for the most part
middle-aged elderly men, sleek and fat, in turbans and
soft linen, white beyond reproach. Each auctioneer, the
prayer over, advanced to the groups of slaves, and led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[<a href="./images/333.png">333</a>]</span>
out one or perhaps two or three, and paraded them
round and round the square under the eyes of the buyers.
At last a bid was made: the auctioneer walked on, pushing
the slaves in front of him, and calling out the amount
of the bid. A higher bid was made: he shouted out that
bid, and still walked on. Then a purchaser signed to him
that he wished to look at the slaves. The auctioneer at
once marshalled the women or woman slave (there were
many more women than men) up to the Moor who wished
to examine her. She squatted in front of him, while he
looked at her teeth, felt her arms, neck, and legs, and
in a low voice asked her a string of private questions.
After a time the woman was allowed to get up, the
auctioneer called out the latest bid for her, and walked
her on. Probably some one else would examine her
"points," and another and another; and her price would
go up till the auctioneer should have got what he
wanted, and the woman would be handed over to her
new master.</p>

<p>Some of the slaves walked round with a profoundly
indifferent air&mdash;none of them looked in wild spirits; but,
on the other hand, it was "Kismet" rather than misery
which was written on their faces. It is a rare thing
for any slave to object violently or to make any scene:
as a rule they knelt down obediently enough in front
of the fat Mohammedans, who thrust their fingers
into their mouths, took them by the chin, and treated
them with great familiarity. But, oddly enough, on
one of the nights we attended the market a scene
did occur. A middle-aged woman, absolutely refused
to walk round&mdash;we were told probably because she had
been parted from her child, and could not bear to be
sold. The poor creature wept wildly, and hid her face
in the red cloth round her head. She was, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[<a href="./images/334.png">334</a>]</span>
in the end forced along like a recalcitrant mule, her cloth
torn off, herself made to kneel down at the bidding of
a group of traders, and undergo the usual examination.
Some of the young girls looked shame-faced, shuffling
along behind or in front of the auctioneers with bent
heads. The sad middle-aged woman fetched in the end
seven pounds ten shillings. A little child was going
for three pounds ten. A girl of thirteen&mdash;that is, at her
very best&mdash;was selling for fifteen pounds: she was of
course unusually attractive.</p>

<p>The slave trade of Africa receives an apparent stamp
of legality from the fact that religious warfare and the
taking of prisoners in war and making them slaves are
looked upon as Divine institutions. There is no obligation
on the Mussulman to release slaves, and as long as
wars and raids last, the mass of slaves in Mohammedan
countries tends rather to increase than otherwise, their
progeny ever adding to the original number. There is
no restriction as to the number of slaves or concubines
which a Moor may have: it entirely depends upon his
purse. His women are his luxury, and an expensive one.
A concubine may be sold at any moment, and the
position is thus precarious and varied: it has one saving
clause, which I have already explained&mdash;the woman who
bears a son to her master is free, and at his death his
property will be divided between the sons of concubines
equally with the sons of his wife and wives. Mussulman
raids still continue against the negroes of Central Africa,
against tribes in Persia, in Afghanistan, and other parts
of the world; indeed, as long as Mohammedanism lasts,
there is very little chance of the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>One afternoon we went over the garden belonging to
the late basha of Marrakesh&mdash;Ben Dowd&mdash;almost the only
garden I have ever seen in Morocco which had in it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[<a href="./images/335.png">335</a>]</span>
flowers; and these were roses from Spain, valuable and
beautiful, the pride of the basha. There was a charming
summer-house half built, and a conservatory nearly
finished, in different parts of the garden. In the midst
of his prosperity, only eight months before, Ben Dowd
had been arrested and put into prison. It was the old
tale of jealousy. The Grand Wazeer was afraid of the
basha, and in order to secure himself from harm succeeded
in having Ben Dowd deposed and put entirely out of
harm's way. Though an explanation is always forthcoming
for violent proceedings such as the above, it would
be unwise to assume in Morocco that the explanation had
a grain of truth in it. Wheels within wheels; intrigue after
intrigue; lie, topped by lie, make up the sum of Moorish
diplomacy, and render the coil of politics in that country
an absolutely fascinating study, not because it is so
surreptitious, but because it is clever as well as cunning,
and all the time involves bigger interests than ever appear
on the tapis&mdash;interests which concern France, Austria,
England, Germany, and other Powers, all of whom struggle
for a finger in the seething pie.</p>

<p>To return to Ben Dowd. He was "detained" in a
house&mdash;not ignominiously committed to the common gaol,
an unusual respite&mdash;allowed twelve shillings a day, and
his wife's company. He was in Fez with these restrictions
at the time we were looking over his gardens; and half
of his wives were left behind at his own house, costing
him a pound a day, we were told, in the face of which
his allowance seemed inadequate.</p>

<p>When the Government seized him, no money was found
in his house; but three hundred thousand dollars' worth
of goods in the shape of carpets, mirrors, gilt bedsteads,
etc., were confiscated. His post, however, is still vacant:
he is a good man, and possibly the Government will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[<a href="./images/336.png">336</a>]</span>
repent of its hasty step, and in due time restore such
a valuable servant to favour. On the other hand, Ben
Dowd may be ruined for life.</p>

<p>The bashas and kaids of Morocco were all gnashing
their teeth, while we were at Marrakesh, over the new
system of taxation, which the Sultan and a certain progressive
member of his Government, are endeavouring to
introduce into the country. The main idea in these new
regulations is, that governors will be paid specified salaries
by the Government&mdash;that they will collect taxes as usual,
but send the amount of money collected intact to Court,
not, as has been the custom hitherto, docking off the
half, it may be, and pocketing it as their own pay.
Again, each province has been lately inspected by a
certain number of trustworthy men, who have fixed its
rate of taxation. The countryman is to pay so much
upon his possessions&mdash;for example, ninepence for a cow,
three shillings for a horse, twopence-halfpenny for an
olive-tree, three shillings for a camel, no more and no
less&mdash;instead of having the utmost squeezed out of
him, which has been the practice of the governors up
till now.</p>

<p>The scheme sounds excellent. A letter has been read
aloud in every city and country market-place, apprising the
people of the new law, and they are delighted in proportion,
but scarcely believe that the Government will be
strong enough to enforce it. Indeed, it is hardly probable
that the new taxation system can succeed unless two important
steps are first taken&mdash;the tribes must be disarmed,
and a new set of governors be appointed to take the place
of the old. As long as the tribesmen are armed, there
can never be law and order, any more than there can
be settled peace upon the Indian frontier under the
same conditions. At one moment the tribes will side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[<a href="./images/337.png">337</a>]</span>
with the Government, at another they will take the part
of a governor, at another they will attack a neighbouring
tribe. It is all very well to tax such men justly and
to treat them like civilized beings, instead of trampling
them underfoot, preventing their becoming rich, and
holding them to be ignorant devils; but they are not
civilized, unfortunately&mdash;they have not sufficient education
to know when they are well off and to profit by it.
Every man of them has a gun, and bloodshed and plunder
are life itself to him. Treat him well, he bides his time,
grows rich with the rest of his tribe; together they
descend upon their neighbours, avenge an old wrong,
loot to their hearts' content, perhaps attack the Sultan
himself. But disarm one and all such men, and in the
far future a peaceable agricultural folk may reign in their
stead. It would be a work of time, but it has been
effected before in the annals of history.</p>

<p>The second condition, which would go far towards the
working of the new system of taxation, is the appointment
of new governors. The salary which the governors are
to receive, is a comparatively small one, compared with
the vast sums which they have been in the habit of
accumulating, by means of extortion and by defrauding
the Government. It is hardly fair to expect a man to cut
down his expenses, give up half his wives, sell his slaves,
and fall in the estimation of those under him. The thing
must assuredly lead to dispute, born of peculation, and
fighting must be the inevitable result. But if, on the
other hand, new men are appointed, who from the first
suit their expenditure to their means, a more peaceful
working basis will be established.</p>

<p>The old Oriental policy of the "balance of jealousies"
will doubtless play its useful part: that is to say, each
governor will watch his next-door neighbour like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[<a href="./images/338.png">338</a>]</span>
cat watching a mouse; and if he detect any underhand
dealings, or evasions, or infringements of the new law,
he will report at once to the Sultan, and thereby gain
<i>kudos</i>, perhaps a substantial reward, for himself. In this
way the Government may receive support at the hands of
the men whom it is keeping in order.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The best that we find in our travels is an honest friend. He
is a fortunate voyager who finds many. We travel, indeed, to
find them. They are the end and the reward of life. They
keep us worthy of ourselves; and when we are alone, we are
only nearer to the absent.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great Thursday Market is one of those things
in Marrakesh which, once seen, is stamped deeper
than a hundred other memories upon the mind. It is
held in a sun-baked open space outside the Gate of
the Thursday Market, just beyond the city walls, within
view of the plains and a distant low range of mountains.
Thousands and thousands of tall palms, groves of them,
wave in the wind all over the surrounding country: a
few great watercourses, worn and eaten out of the red
soil, burrow between the forests on their way down to
the great river.</p>

<p>To reach the market we rode out along a road thronged
with people selling all sorts of goods, from splendid old
flintlock guns from the Sus chased with silver and gold
and going at three pounds, to striped carpets strong and
violent in colouring at seven-and-sixpence each, and
second-hand clothes of the most varied description. At
last, topping a little hill, we rode down into the market:
it is, more correctly speaking, a horse fair,&mdash;mules were
also for sale. The horses down in the south are without
doubt very different from the poor little ponies bred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[<a href="./images/342.png">342</a>]</span>
up in the north; but even these, in comparison, for
instance, with a thoroughbred hunter at home, fell far
short of what my defective imagination had led me to
expect of Arab stallions in Morocco. For the most
part there was nothing for sale except great heavy
brutes with small heads and proud arched necks. Every
one of them fell away in the hindquarters.</p>

<p>As usual the sale was prefaced by a prayer: hard
bargaining, sharp practice, and much or little swindling,
inseparable from horse-dealing, must all of it, first of
all, be watered by prayer. Therefore the horsemen
formed into a line; the central figure chanted some
verses from the Kor&#257;n; the rest held out their hands
palms upwards, then joined in a sort of Amen, the instant
afterwards sticking their spurs into their horses
and dashing forward, charging in a line over the plain
between two rows of spectators, and pulling the horses
up on to their haunches at the end, red with spur-marks
and white with foam. This was repeated two or three
times, the short space in which the riders pulled up
out of a full gallop being sometimes almost incredible;
then a great circle was formed of would-be purchasers
and onlookers, and the horses were ridden into the
circle and then round and round to display themselves,
each rider at the same time <i>auctioning his own horse</i>,
yelling out the bids for it, as they rose, at the top of
his voice. When the last bid was made, and he could
get no more, the rider, after shouting the price, added
that he "would not consult the absent one," meaning
thereby that the owner of the horse, whether himself
or not, would raise no objection to the animal's being sold
for that price. Unless this sentence had been pronounced,
the purchaser could not have been certain that the
owner would not say afterwards he did not intend to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[<a href="./images/343.png">343</a>]</span>
sell for that sum. Most of the horses fetched from
three pounds twelve to four pounds ten.</p>

<p>Mules were sold in the same way&mdash;the prayer, the
parade round the circle, each rider seated almost on
his mule's tail, urging him on, with hands and heels, to
pace his best, the mule's nose up in the heavens. Some
of them were splendid animals, which I would have
given anything to have possessed&mdash;perfectly made, looking
more intelligent than many humans, and full of pluck
and staying power: these fetched rather more than
double, what the best horse in the whole market sold for.
But in criticising the horses, I speak of what I saw on
this occasion: there may be, and no doubt are, fine arabs
to be had in Southern Morocco&mdash;at least so I am told&mdash;but
I came across only what may be called "a cart-horse
stamp."</p>

<p>And yet they look very fine, these same sensible-looking
beasts, with their great eyes, and flowing manes
and tails, and proud carriage. There is something, too,
eternally fascinating in the beautiful seat of an Arab
on his horse&mdash;not of a fat sheikh or a rich basha or
a thriving merchant, but that of the lean and wiry Arab
horseman born and bred, who, as he thunders past at
full gallop, puts himself into a dozen positions, is at
home in them all, shoots behind him, above him, below
him, without drawing rein, turning in any direction, while
he makes the whole air ring with his wild cries. The
Moorish saddle of course helps his grip; but beyond
that, there is something cat-like in the lithe swing of
his body, and it is that body's right and natural function
to be upon a horse. The white turban, the flowing white
garments, the gorgeously coloured saddle, the great
silvered stirrups, are all part of the whole&mdash;and an attractive
whole&mdash;born of the limitless desert, the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[<a href="./images/344.png">344</a>]</span>
far-reaching sky, the pure wind: it is Arabian, that is
all&mdash;<i>and so much</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, camels were selling in another corner of
the market, being made to lie down and rise and generally
show themselves off: they were fetching from three
pounds ten upwards. Cows, goats, and sheep were less
interesting; but the throng of men which filled up the
fair was, as ever, more than a study. Above and beyond
all, stood out the wild inhabitants of the Atlas, and
men from the Sus, wearing black camel's-hair jellabs
with a great russet-red or saffron-yellow patch let into
the backs of them. The origin of this striking "badge"
is not known, but the jellabs themselves looked absolutely
in keeping with the lawless ruffians, on whose shoulders
they hung, and the wild blotch of bizarre colour was
"just themselves."</p>

<p>Bay, is the colour which in a horse the Moor chooses
first&mdash;the pearl of colours, sober and most hardy; while
a light chestnut brings ill luck, though a dark chestnut
is the colour of the wind, can "travel," and was
Mohammed's favourite. A horse must have the colour
of its saddle in harmony with itself&mdash;an apple-green
saddle for a black horse, scarlet for a white, the whole
beautifully worked and embossed in silk, and when on the
horse's back, should be set, perhaps, upon as many as <i>nine</i>
different coloured saddle-cloths, one on top of each other.</p>

<p>Of all filthy quarters in the filthiest of cities, I think
the Jewish Quarter in Marrakesh has a fair chance of
ranking first,&mdash;outside it, rubbish, a manure-heap eighty
feet high, which no one troubles to remove; inside the
walls, black mud, feet deep, streets which are sewers, collections
of dead dogs, rotting vegetables, refuse of all sorts;
amongst it all, a dirty people, callous beyond belief as
regards sanitation, with sore heads, sore eyes, matted rags.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[<a href="./images/345.png">345</a>]</span>
Not a butcher's shop which is not black with flies and "high"
with rotten meat: flies lie upon every article of food.</p>

<p>And in the very <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'votex'">vortex</ins> of this muck-heap&mdash;astounding
to the traveller&mdash;are content to live wealthy Jews, happy
to flourish all their lives shoulder to shoulder with unutterable
squalor.</p>

<p>We went over a house belonging to a Jew millionaire,
well built, lavishly decorated, as luxurious as money and
Morocco would permit, evidently the pride of the whole
family. Probably few of them went far outside the city
walls: they were born to the Mellah. His success as
a trader might have given the head of the house a
country place in England, shady lawns, a carriage and
pair to drive in: he preferred his own muck-heap. But
I cannot conceive upon what he spent his money, other
than the glorification of the inside of his house.</p>

<p>The Sultan's palace looked deserted: it is long, however,
since he left it, and high time he was in Fez again; for Fez
is more in touch with Europe&mdash;Fez means a shade more
progression and civilization than life in Morocco City.
Round the palace lay bales of goods which had been
ordered by him and sent out from England&mdash;things such
as waggons, motor-cars possibly, which are supposed so
much to shock his narrow-minded subjects. They imagine
that his Shar&#299;fian Majesty wastes vast sums of money;
whereas for a great monarch, the ruler of an empire, his
private bills are probably absurdly small. He may have
fireworks let off every night for ten minutes, horrifying
Marrakesh; but the cost of his amusements, considering
his position, must be curiously reasonable: so one considered,
as one looked at the "parcels" awaiting his return
to the capital, which lay in the immense courtyard outside
his palace, where "powder play" is held, and where he
receives foreign ambassadors, marching through the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[<a href="./images/346.png">346</a>]</span>
gateway which leads to his own private rooms, over which
is inscribed in Arabic an odd sentence; it reads literally,
"What God wills: there is no power but God."</p>

<p>The days passed, and our time in Marrakesh drew to
an end. In spite of all that had been told us in Tangier,
of the difficulties and dangers which would attend an
expedition into the Atlas Mountains, in spite of the
verdict that we should not be given a permit, should
be "stopped and not allowed to continue the journey," we
found that, once upon the scene of action, there would have
been little difficulty in getting at least as far as Glaouia,
and in pushing up through one or two other passes.</p>

<p>The ride to Glaouia might take five or six days: there
were several other places and a district or two which would
have been worth visiting ten times over. The missionaries
in Marrakesh were willing to make all arrangements:
one of them would have gone with us, and under that
escort it would have been possible to travel into the
Atlas without risk. We should have gone "privately,"
without troubling any one, without formality; and in all
probability no one would have troubled about us: that,
after all, is the only way to travel satisfactorily in Morocco,
not with half a <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dozon'">dozen</ins> soldiers and a vast noise.</p>

<p>But for this year at any rate our travels in Morocco
had reached their limit. R. was not strong enough to
face more marching: the hot sun, long rides, and general
"roughing it" had told upon her, and the responsibility
of taking her on farther afield, into remote regions of
uncertain climate, was too great.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-48.png"><img src="./images/ill-48_th.png" alt="THE RIVER TENSIF OUTSIDE MARRAKESH." title="THE RIVER TENSIF OUTSIDE MARRAKESH." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">The River Tensif Outside Marrakesh.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><i>Photo by A. Cavilla, Tangier.</i></p>

<p>Early one morning we set forth upon our last march,
back again to the coast, by the track which leads
eventually to Mazagan, a seaport some distance farther
north than Mogador. Here we hoped to pick up a
steamer, and proceed, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Tangier, across to Gibraltar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>[<a href="./images/347.png">347</a>]</span>
where it would be possible to get a P. &amp; O. boat and
head for home.</p>

<p>The march to Mazagan was easy, and contained little
incident. After leaving the plains of Marrakesh and
its waving palm-trees, and seeing the tall Kutobea
disappear at last, we found ourselves in the "Little
Mountains," and along the rough road began to fall
in continually with parties of tribesmen, Arab country
people, all mounted, who had been commandeered to
accompany the Sultan as far as Fez, and who were
now coming back to their homes. Splendid bronzed
fellows they were, dark brick-dust colour, wrapped in
long white cloaks, with the hood of an under garment
pulled down over their faces: sometimes a white cloth
swathed their heads; their chins were hidden in soft
folds which reached up to their hawk-eyes, veiling the
face, like true sons of the desert, as a protection against
sun and wind. Guns were slung across their shoulders:
they wore long yellow riding-boots and spurs, with
half a dozen saddle-cloths; and all rode horses, strong
little beasts, well groomed, some hog-maned, but usually
with great locks of hair sweeping over their necks, and their
tails almost touching the ground behind. On grey or white
countrybreds as a rule, they wound along the mountain
path in single file, these tall white-cloaked horsemen, in
nowise differing from their ancestors of a thousand years
ago&mdash;Arabs of unbroken descent: as they emerged from
between the wild hills it would have been hard to find
a more picturesque sight.</p>

<p>One of the few peaceful camping-grounds between
Marrakesh and Mazagan was at a little distance outside
an Arab village of about thirty little pointed thatched
huts, enclosed within a zareba of thorn-bushes: it was
called Smeera.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[<a href="./images/348.png">348</a>]</span>
We camped near some trees and water: the fig-trees
were full of crows, which came in to roost in thousands,
and The Little Owl (<i>Athene noctua</i>) haunted the place.
In the early half-light of the morning this wise-looking
little bird was found, when we awoke, to be sitting upon the
edge of the flap of the tent in the doorway, gazing in upon
us with round yellow eyes; nor was it the least nervous.</p>

<p>I recollect how, the evening before, there sat outside
Smeera, as so often may be seen outside the like
villages, away beyond the huts and the zareba, where
it was very quiet, upon some flat grey stones, eight or
twelve village men&mdash;Arabs. Sitting there in the sunset,
wrapped in their white hooded mantles, this conclave of
wise white owls, easily to be mistaken for grey stones,
so rigid are their backs&mdash;of what do they talk as the
hours go by? There is no joke nor song nor a drop
of liquor going, as in a "public," where our labourers at
home would naturally congregate. But this charmed circle
sits on, staring into the west: the tall bearded wheat
rustles in the wind close to them; the illimitable plain
stretches away to the horizon, flat as their own uneventful
lives; the sun drops behind the soft straight line
of Earth; they do not move,&mdash;wondrous picturesque
figures, long white folds, peaked hoods, sitting, their
knees drawn up to their chins, for how long? What
is time to an Arab?</p>

<p>One evening our camel never turned up, and we fully
expected to have had to sleep without beds or any
other of the night's usual adjuncts. We had started that
morning at seven, had ridden till twelve, had halted for
an hour and a half, starting again at half-past one, and
riding till half-past five; and all the way, after a mile
out of Sok-el-Tleta, where we watered the mules at a
pond and the trail forked, we were on the wrong road.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[<a href="./images/349.png">349</a>]</span>
Only the man with the camel knew the Mazagan line of
march thoroughly well: he had explained it beforehand to
Omar. Omar made a mistake, and the camel and attendants
were behind ourselves. However, news travels oddly
fast in uncivilized countries, and the camel-driver heard
after a time that the "advance squadron" was on the
wrong trail. He set out after us, and ran and walked,
and caught us at three o'clock in the afternoon. The
wretched camel followed his steps all the way, with
Mulai Ombach in charge of our baggage, three donkeys,
and a boy, who were afraid of being cut off from us,
and dared not risk a night by themselves. The camel-driver
put us right, Omar and Sa&iuml;d were well cursed,
and we began a toilsome journey across rough country,
hoping to hit the right trail in time.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in the wildest and dirtiest of
Arab encampments now and again, where infuriated dogs,
unaccustomed to visitors, rushed out and almost bit us
upon our mules, amidst a hail of stones from Omar and
Sa&iuml;d. A valley luxuriating knee-deep in flowers&mdash;the
Flower Valley we called it&mdash;was the one redeeming
feature of that march. There are certain times for seeing
the wild flowers in Morocco&mdash;perhaps April in the south
is the best month: so far we had not been as much
struck by them as report would lead one to expect. And
yet they were most beautiful. Picture corn-fields full of
love-in-a-mist; orchards of fig-trees, with the grass ablaze
with golden pyrethrums; red mallow standing up in
the barley; the ground carpeted with blue-and-white
convolvulus; masses of carmine-coloured convolvulus
densely festooned over the thorn-hedges; on the barest,
stoniest of soil stretches of cistus, pale pink to faded
mauve; asphodels everywhere; sometimes the wild spring
form of the cultivated artichoke, the small variety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[<a href="./images/350.png">350</a>]</span>
the ice-plant, the larkspur, the lupin, and several
varieties of lavender. All these we met with, over and
over again: rarer plants were to be found for the looking.
R. collected specimens of them all, to be classified by
the authorities at Kew Gardens on our return.</p>

<p>The Flower Valley yielded one or two which we
had not seen before, and we would have lingered there,
but that time was precious and we had no notion of
our exact whereabouts. It was a case of going on and
on and meeting no one: evening began to draw near,
and still we were off the right track, while our baggage
might be anywhere. There was nothing for it but to
push forward and trust to luck: in time we cut into
innumerable little paths, which snaked side by side in
the same direction across the plain, pointing towards
the coast, and these we surmised to be the trail to
Mazagan, which proved to be correct. But at that
moment, though we were anything but certain, it had
become absolutely necessary to halt for the night. It
was dark, and the mules were done. An Arab village
lay on a hillside not far off, and we made for it.</p>

<p>Omar and Sa&iuml;d had with them on their mules our
tent and two or three necessaries for cooking: we had
therefore a roof over our heads, and in time a fire was
made, odds and ends were scraped up, and we ate a
meal of sorts sitting on the ground beside a candle stuck
on a stone. The night grew very cold: there was, however,
a bit of thin carpet, which we proposed to wrap
ourselves in to sleep. Now and then one of us looked
out between the flaps of the tent into the darkness and
watched&mdash;a case of "Sister Ann! Sister Ann! do you
see any one coming?"</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill-49.png"><img src="./images/ill-49_th.png" alt="ONE OF OUR LAST CAMPS. LOADING THE CAMEL." title="ONE OF OUR LAST CAMPS. LOADING THE CAMEL." /></a></p>
<p class="sc">One of Our Last Camps. Loading the Camel.</p>

<p>We had, however, grown tired of looking out, and were
just arranging ourselves on the ground, when familiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[<a href="./images/351.png">351</a>]</span>
noises sounded outside, and Omar's voice crying joyfully,
"Le chameau arrive!"</p>

<p>Perhaps, above all else which was interesting on the
road to Mazagan, the little Arab settlements, composed
entirely of tents, interested us most. In them, was lived
the truly nomad, gipsy life of the wandering Arab, who
is a herdsman by heritage, and in following that vocation
<i>a roamer par excellence</i>. They live, these Arabs, in
tents: the sides are made of straw and wattle hurdles;
over the top is stretched an immense piece of brown
or black camel's-hair cloth. The tents are barely five
feet high in the middle, less at the edges: squat brown
mushrooms they look, or something like the keels of
boats turned bottom upwards. All of them were open
in front, "very public" the world would say; which
primitive and open-air mode of living was indeed their
great feature. Some of them were divided off down
the middle by a hurdle, thus forming two "rooms":
the hurdles were occasionally faggots, without straw.
Around the tents lay the flocks, chewing the cud or
browsing on the scanty grass-land: children ran out to
us with bowls of milk: when the grass gave out within
reach all round, the tents were taken down, the hillsides
deserted, and the families wandered in search of pastures
new, carrying a few chickens, some pots and pans, two
or three bundles of rags, and leaving behind a good
many parasites and a bare patch.</p>

<p>Thus Arab life in Southern Morocco&mdash;a thriftless, desultory
existence, yet with the charm of continual change
and of living with the earth. "To take no thought for
the morrow" is the practice of all Moors, whether Arabs
or Berbers: no Moor spends money on anything which
will not bring him in immediate profit, and this accounts
for the fact that trees and forests are never planted, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>[<a href="./images/352.png">352</a>]</span>
schemes started for working mines, or roads made,
or bridges built; even if the capital were forthcoming,
what would be the use of spending money only to be
repaid little by little, year by year?&mdash;a man may die before
he profits for all his trouble!</p>

<p>After all, argues the Moor, who could wish to alter
Morocco? Is it not perfect as it is?&mdash;veritably, "<i>the
tail of the peacock</i>," the sun of the universe!</p>

<p>Its very imperfections are among those things which
in this fanatical Mohammedan land so fascinate the
traveller. Its sad colours, its air steeped in mystery,
its courtly unknowable people, its wild tribes, its white
shut houses, its concealed women, its mad fanaticism,
its magnificent stoicism&mdash;one and all are sufficient to
hold the European, and to call him back again long after
El Moghreb has forgotten his face. Another of those
chains has been forged which bind certain places and
certain countries to a soul, each henceforth belonging
the one to the other, and each gaining a little something
thereby; nor can the links of these chains be
broken, since unseen possessions, such as they, are among
those things which no power on earth can touch, which can
neither be given nor taken away.</p>
